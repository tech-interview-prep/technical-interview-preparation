Given a string, write a function that return if it is Palindrome. This wasn't asked directly but from interviewer example i was need to understand that this function must ignore all spaces and special symbols.

Given an array, write a function that return true if any 3 elements of this array can sum to 0. My first solution was the simplest and far from best which result in O(n^3). Then interviewer asked me to improve to improve it to O(n^2). This give me a hint that i can use Hash to reduce complexity.

in the phone interview: - pretty basic python algorithm question. Having read the others here, I assumed I&#039;d get pitched a softball and then a harder question. I was able to solve it within the first several minutes, but spent the rest of the session trying to optimize the solution. - some basic SQL questions on joins and such. I answered probably 5 or 6 questions. Both of these interviews seemed like minimum bar screens. For the in-person interview: - more difficult python question and had to code on a white board. It was a pretty simple sorting question that was easy to solve but less trivial to optimize. - more difficult SQL questions. I struggled here but I was a bit weaker in SQL so I figured as much. This progressed into dashboard design. - Lunch was at a cafe on campus and delicious. Interviewer was just asking me about work experience and culture and it seemed just like a general personality compatibility test. - Full Stack interview was my favorite part and a lot of fun. Without giving too much away, I was given a realistic problem and tasked with conceptualizing the solution in real time, from start to finish, on a white board. It was a mix of coding and conceptual and seemed to be meant to test product sense.

Given a number and a array. Python code to find sum of any 2 numbers in a list is equal to a given number.

SQL question mostly on case when, joins ex: Q3: delete all dupliactes from a table in one query

Mostly the interviewer was cornering me by asking not to use regular ways, so he was expecting the answers in a particular way, ex: can't use joins, sub query etc which made very simple questions tough

Apr 29, 2015
---------------
The interviewer in the first phone screen for SQL was very professional. He explained the questions clearly and clearly defined what he was looking for. Multiple SQL questions were asked. The interviewer in the second phone screen was equally unprofessional and very rude. He was not able to explain the question clearly and was shouting on the phone. I was very surprised and disappointed to see such people taking interviews and making hiring decisions.

All in all, they seemed to be interested just as much in my ability to communicate as they were in my technical skills. It was important to be able to talk about the product and how people engaged with it and relating those things back to the data that was given.

Data challenge was very similar to the ads analysis challenge on the book the collection of data science takehome challenge, so that was easy (if you have done your homework). SQL was: you have a table where you have date, user_id, song_id and count. It shows at the end of each day how many times in her history a user has listened to a given song. So count is cumulative sum. You have to update this on a daily basis based on a second table that records in real time when a user listens to a given song. Basically, at the end of each day, you go to this second table and pull a count of each user/song combination and then add this count to the first table that has the lifetime count. If it is the first time a user has listened to a given song, you won't have this pair in the lifetime table, so you have to create the pair there and then add the count of the last day. Onsite: lots of ads related and machine learning questions. How to build an ad model, how to test it, describe a model. I didn't do well in some of these.

First, A rolls a fair 6-sided die, and the number on the die determines how many stones A takes over from B. Next, B rolls the same die, and the exact same thing happens in reverse. This concludes the round. Whoever has more stones at the end of the round wins and the game is over.

Now there are two new technologies, X and Y (of equal cost). If apply X, mpg of A would increase from 50 mpg to 75 mpg; If apply Y, mpg of B would increase from 10 mpg to 11 mpg. The goal is to decrease the dependence on foreign oil, or to decrease the consumption of gasoline. Question: which technology would you apply? Follow up question: after applying the technology of your choice, assume there's money available for research on new technology, which car would you choose to conduct research on?

I would say the question was expected but there were tricks. It would not be easy to get them right in one time under the interview setting.

Aug 26, 2014
---------------
I was surprised that there were no machine learning or data mining questions, or any personality/experience ("tell me about a time when you...") questions. The more technical questions were things that a graduating CS student would succeed at, but did not involve principles that you would actually use in practice in a data role at a company. Also, make sure you continue working on a problem until you've provided the most efficient solution you think you can. I stopped after I had a working solution, and indicated to the interviewer that I don't think it's the most efficient solution. The interviewer said it was fine and we moved on to another question. Nonetheless, the biggest piece of feedback I got from the recruiter afterwards is that I didn't provide a solution that was sufficiently efficient.

Apr 13, 2014
---------------
Again, I can't talk about the specific question, but after I wrote up a simple algorithm, the interviewer asked me for a more efficient solution. I really struggled with that.

Mar 22, 2014

Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated (Full question + answer: Cracking the Coding Interview Chapter 11 Question 2).

Given API: int Read4K(char* buf); It reads data from a file and records the position so that the next time when it is called it read the next 4k chars (or the rest of the file, whichever is smaller) from the file. The return is the number of chars read. Todo: Use above API to Implement API "int Read(char* buf, int n)" which reads any number of chars from the file.

Given a mapping of alphabets to integers as follows: 1 = A 2 = B 3 = C ... 26 = Z Given any combination of the mapping numbers as string, return the number of ways in which the input string can be split into sub-strings and represented as character strings. For e.g. given "111" -&gt; "AAA", "AK", "KA" -&gt; 3 Valid combinations are ({1,1,1}, {1,11},{11,1}) = 3 "11" -&gt; "AA", "K" -&gt; 2 Valid combinations are ({1,1},{11}) = 2 "123" -&gt; "ABC", "LC", "AW" -&gt; 3 Valid combinations are ({1,2,3},{1,23},{12,3}) = 3 You don't have to return all the mappings, only the number of valid mappings.

Screening interview only: a technical coding challenge, medium to difficult involving trees. The question can be found in online training material or books but I didn't resolve it before.

Sep 9, 2015
---------------
Except experience related questions I was asked coding question and I was supposed to write the solution to the problem in any programming language in a simple web-based code editor. The question was: given and array of positive integers and another integer find whether there is a consecutive range in the array, so that the sum of integers in the range is equal to the given number. They put an emphasis on delivering working, efficient solution. In my opinion this kind of interview requires a thorough preparation.

It was one of the easiest interview that i had and completely unexpected from company like facebook. Limited set of questions and one question per round. Total 2 coding questions and one design question and lastly cultural fit round. Its completely unfair to have less number of questions and that too relatively easy ones. It doesnt give much scope of creativity and thinking and a small mistake can prove to be too costly. As compared to this, Google,Amazon,Microsoft each have 4-5 rounds with 2-3 questions in each round thus giving enough scope to express yourself. Questions asked in event: Implement hashmap, count distinct numbers in a large file, design pub-sub, design twitter feed system

Establish rapport with your interviewer, remember to ask clarifying questions, talk through your thinking process and solutions and you'll do well. Hopefully better than me:) Best of luck!

Before I get to the question I just want to say that the interviewer had a very thick accent (I'm an international candidate, BTW), and that made it really difficult for me to understand what he wanted me to do. This isn't me being bitter. I'm saying this so that I present a very honest opinion about my interview. That being said, the question wasn't something that can be found online or in most books, I was given 2 functions String recv() and String ReadLine() [ both these DO NOT take arguments]. recv() generates some string (Example:"123\n45\n6789"). ReadLine() should read the string being returned by recv() and print all characters until the first \n. After that it should read the recv() string again and print the next characters until the 2nd \n. Example: recv(): "123\n45\n6789"                ReadLine(): "123" //first call of ReadLine                ReadLine(): "45" // second call of ReadLine However, the next sequence now doesn't have a \n. So, once the end of the string is hit, the ReadLine() function must call recv() again, and append all characters until it reads a \n. Continuing the above example: ReadLine():6789abcde //Third call of ReadLine                                                   recv():"abc"// still no \n...so you must call recv() again                                                   recv():"de\n" The commented sections are my explanations (the interviewer didn't give any such things). I've explained the problem as clearly as I can. Unfortunately, the interviewer kept overwriting his examples, and (I have to emphasize this) his accent made it really hard to understand just what he wanted out of this program.

As for the interview itself, I was asked several general questions about my projects (nothing too special, really). The coding question is a standard regular expression matching one which you can find on LeetCode. Since I'm still doing my Master program, I haven't yet reached that far on LeetCode. I did solve the question in the end after the interviewer gave me some hint...But I don't think I did a very good job.

I think the most difficult part were not the coding question itself but that they were the kind of questions where you have to be recall a lot from basic computer science classes. Things you tend to forget if you have already been working for a couple of years. But then again, that was not necessarily unexpected.

How to get out from a maze

You a have a vector with the heights of an island (at point 1, point 2 etc) and you want to know how much water would remain on this island (without flowing away)

Write a function that takes a list of words as input, and returns a list of those words bucketized by anagrams with duplicates removed. Example: Input: ["star", "rats", "car", "arc", "arts", "rats", "bar"] Output: [["star", "rats", "arts"], ["car", "arc"], ["bar"]] 

Given 2 interval ranges, create a function to tell me if these ranges intersect. Both start and end are inclusive: [start, end] Given 2 interval ranges that intersect, now create a function to merge the 2 ranges into a single continuous range. Now create a function that takes a group of unsorted, unorganized intervals, merge any intervals that intersect and sort them. The result should be a group of sorted, non-intersecting intervals. Now create a function to merge a new interval into a group of sorted, non-intersecting intervals. After the merge, all intervals should remain non-intersecting. You are given the function definition below.

I expected a tirade of technical questions. The unexpected part was that the interview was both ways: they interviewed me, I interviewed them. Most parts were more like brainstorming session than exams. The most difficult question was when a guy showed me a gdb stack trace of the threads within a process which hung. It was an facebook internal application, so I had no previous knowledge of that application. The question was what went wrong. Luckily, it was a clear situation where all threads were waiting for a blocked thread.

The initial question (writing a function to calculate a square root) ended up being the most difficult because it threw me off. I knew there was a good iterative method for doing so, but could not recall Newton's method in the moment, and I sadly let this nagging thought get in the way of my ability to work through the problem. My failure to perform well on that question set a negative tone for the rest of the interview, since each interviewer after the first can see notes from the previous interviewers.

You are given an integer N and an integer M. You are supposed to write a method void findBestCoinsThatMinimizeAverage(int N, int M) that prints the best collection of N coins that minimize the average number of minimum coins needed to generate values from 1 to M. So, if M = 100, and N = 4, then if we use the set {1, 5, 10, 25} to generate each value from 1 to 100, so that for each value the number of coins are minimized, i.e. 1 = 1 (1 coin), 2 = 1 + 1 (2 coins),..., 6 = 1 + 5 (2 coins), ..., 24 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (8 coins), and we take the average of these coins, we would see that the average comes out to ~5.7. But if we instead use {1, 5, 18, 25}, the average would come out to be 3.7. We are to find that set of N coins, and print them, that produce the minimum average.

You have a single branch of a GIT or SVN repository. At some commit number G, the code in the repo worked (G = good commit). At a later commit number B, you noticed that the code was broken (B = bad). The code may have become broken anytime at or before B, but after G. B was just the first time that you noticed the code was broken. Both G and B are positive integers and G < B. You have access to a function.......bool isCommitGood(integer)......... that takes a commit number and tells you whether the code at that commit worked or was broken. Write code to find the most recent working commit (i.e., the number/index of the last good commit before the code became broken).

You have an unsorted array of integers and a function........string getCategory(integer)........which deterministically returns 1 of three possible strings: "low", "medium", or "high", depending on the input integer. You need to output an array with all the "low" numbers at the bottom, all the "medium" numbers in the middle, and all the "high" numbers at the top. This is basically a partial sort. Within each category, the order of the numbers does not matter...For example, you might be give the array [5,7,2,9,1,14,12,10,5,3]. For input integers 1 - 3, getCategory(integer) returns "low", for 4 - 10 it returns "medium," and for 11 - 15 it returns "high". You could output an array (or modify the given array) that looks like this: [3,1,2,5,5,9,7,10,14,12]

No very difficult questions. Just take it easy and enjoy the process. Almost all of the question are from the &lt;Cracking the Coding Interview&gt;. A quick response and emphasize on the issue of efficiency are important. I think Facebook love to ask questions about the tree structure and some practical questions because they are realistic problems. When you prepare and practice, do remember that efficiency is a really significant issue, much more important than simply giving an answer. And I would like recommend another book &lt;Programming pearls&gt;. Maybe the book is not a hard one to read, but the thought of the author, why the author wants to improve some algorithm and how he solves problems are really fantastic. The questions are from realistic problems and the book is really worth reading several times. It benefits me a lot.
