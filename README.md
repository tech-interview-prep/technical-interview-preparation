# Tech Interview Preparation:

This repository contains resources I use to prepare for the technical interviews (specific to SDE/SWE) at various companies.

By default, I use the following 20 day action plan for the interviews or might create a separate action plan in articles directory based on the time I have

## A 20 day action plan for preparing for technical interviews.

As Eric Schmidt says, “Repetition doesn’t spoil the prayer.”

Hours per day: 4-5 hours per day (7pm - 12am)
