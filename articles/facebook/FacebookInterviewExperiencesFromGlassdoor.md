I was recruited via LinkedIn, attended a prep session and then met on the phone for my first technical interview. My interviewer called 15 minutes early and skipped the background introductions to ask me about something on my CV from 2012 which he liked. I think it was a rare interview and probably wouldn't happen again to someone else.

They really want you to pass the interview by giving you lots of preparation material. The format of the interviews and the questions were exactly what I prepared for. You can find the coding questions on CareerCup. The architectural question is shown below. I've only got myself to blame for not passing the interview by not performing as I prepared.

They contacted me via Linkedin. Asked 6 multiple choice questions. You have to answer at least 5 of them correctly to proceed to next step. First interview is conducted via skype but it was just sound, no video so you can cheat. Note: I did not apply for a position in Facebook so I suspected that the person who contacted me was really a FB employee. I found out that ...@fb.com mail addresses are valid facebook mail addresses.

1.Given a string, write a function that return if it is Palindrome. This wasn't asked directly but from interviewer example i was need to understand that this function must ignore all spaces and special symbols. 2. Given an array, write a function that return true if any 3 elements of this array can sum to 0. My first solution was the simplest and far from best which result in O(n^3). Then interviewer asked me to improve to improve it to O(n^2). This give me a hint that i can use Hash to reduce complexity.   11 Answers

Contacted by recruiter. I've been asked "entry-point" questions like AndroidManifest, layouts as well as activity lifecycle. Some HR questions, nothing special. Once it's passed, you might be contacted/referred to other tech recruiter, so in the process you will talk to 2 or more tech requirers as well as Directory of Engineering. All people are always nice and understand any your situations. Once this is done, first call with engineer will be scheduled. I've been told should expect 1-2 calls where you answer on questions, then written questions about algorithms. I've passed first call and been invited on site interview. All flights, times, taxi, food and any other expenses covered by Facebook. All people are welcomed in HQ as well as helpful. Everybody seems to be very excited and enthusiastic about what they all are doing in the company. On site interview has walk around campus and 4 45 mins + lunch time in campus. You have to have deep understanding about Android platform, have a good experience covering a lot of sides of Android SDK as well as algorithms and their complexity. Very thankful for such a great experience overall.

A recruiter reached on linkedin and set up an initial call to discuss about background. Next was two phone screens - 1) SQL 2) Any preferred language (I picked Python) Each phone screen is 45 minutes and you are asked about 6-7 questions. The questions are relatively straightforward if you are comfortable with basics. In coding interview, they are trying to see if you can approach the same program in two different ways - one using inbuilt methods and one without using in built methods

The interview process was pretty streamlined. First, I received an email from the HR asking for an informal discussion. After I set up a time, we had almost a 50 minutes discussion about what I have worked in past and what are my skill sets. Also, the HR explained me about the job profile in detail. After a couple of weeks, the HR confirmed to me about the telephonic rounds. There were two back to back telephonic rounds, coding followed by an SQL round. For the first round, I was called around 5 minutes late for the interview. The interviewer asked me about my previous work experience and then asked to start coding. The questions were pretty simple and I could answer all of them. There was one that required little thinking but I eventually solved it. I already had my next round of interview scheduled so the interviewer said that he could not ask me further questions. It was a very abrupt end to my interview although I solved all the questions. The second round was on SQL queries and this was really easy to crack. The queries were complex but I knew the concept and so could form them correctly. Only the last question asked for little complex related to cross join. I managed to answer but could not get the correct answer. This interview lasted longer than 45 minutes. The interviewer was very friendly and communicated very professionally. After both the rounds, I was very confident that I had cracked the interview as I could solve all the questions asked. But unfortunately, I got an email after a week saying that I have not cleared the round. This was very surprising to me as I kept wondering where I went wrong. I asked the recruiter about a feedback but she refused to give any. I don't know if it's their mistake or what but I still wonder what went wrong.

Questions were based on Arraylist and its manipulations. SQL questions were related to joins and fetching highest salary and stuff. pretty basic.   1 Answer

Got the first round phone interview. The recruitment HR was really sweet. Sent me the details of what to expect and asked me to schedule a date for interviews in a few days. Scheduled it a week later. There were 2 rounds of interview and both the interviewers were really nice. I was not satisfied with the process though. The second HR who scheduled my interview sent me a tentative time in the evening, however, on the day of the interview I got a mail that the interview is in an hour and it was supposed to be a.m. and not p.m. The interviewers did not have my phone number or resume, fortunately we were logged in into a shared coding platform from where we exchanged numbers. Also, the position advertised a heavy dependency on SQL and data modeling, and also the mail that the HR sent to me about what to expect stressed a lot on SQL and data modeling. However, I wasn't asked a single question about it but the interview rather focussed on only programming in python. When asked them about this, the reason was that SQL is easy to pick up and hence they don't stress much on it.

It took me 2.5 weeks just to receive the Thanks but no thanks email! Technical bar for this position is very low, questions are easy especially on SQL. However, they are looking for a person also can work with BI team so there are some requirements on the non-technical side, e.g product sense. Do prepare to be interviewed by "manager" people who doesnt asset based on technical skills but your manner and personality. I was quite surprised when one of them asked me why I have 8 years of experience but already worked for 7 companies.

The process started with my submission of a resume. Several months later, I was invited to a phone interview with a recruiter. After that, there was a 45 minute technical phone interview that covered a basic palindrome detection coding exercise that I solved in Python. Several days afterwards, I was invited to a second 45 minute phone interview that focused on performing a merge-sort with pure SQL. Finally, I was invited to fly out to Menlo Park and interview on-site for an interview loop. The phone interviews went relatively smoothly, both interviewers were incredibly kind and professional. The on-site interview was an amazing experience, but was a night and day difference from the difficulty of the phone interviews. Although substantial in subject, each interviewer was again kind and professional and I got the honest feeling they wanted me to succeed. It was the first interview I've ever had where I didn't feel attacked interrogated and felt at complete ease. Facebook has done a wonderful job at cultivating a supportive and encouraging culture which shone through during the entire interview process. That all said, my best advice for those interview is to not let the colloquial atmosphere lull you into a sense of ease. While the interviews are warm and helpful, their ultimate goal was to choose prime candidates. Be yourself, be honest, but never "let your guard down" and choose your words carefully. Every response is measured! Some technical notes on how to prepare (and consequently things I think I fell below the grade on!): 1. Be able to effortlessly calculate Big O for any given algorithm. 2. Be ready to use both built-in solutions for your chosen programming language and custom. For example, splitting a string by spaces "by hand" and using a built-in. 3. Switch gears between iterative and recursive. It may not matter what is the most efficient route, but the interviewer may want to see if you're able to solve the problem with either approach. 4. Ask for your boundaries. Can you use more than one technology? Can you offload some of the work to the DB? Can you use built-ins? 5. Understand the fundamentals for everything you say. For example, know when to approach query optimization with an index and when to solve it with summary tables. 6. Triple check with your Uber drive to make sure they know the right building to go to ;)

- Employee referral to Phone Screen - Phone Interview with web coding (algorithm + SQL) via coderpad.io - In-person Interview with data structure/algorithm coding, sql coding, a "lunch" that was essentially a compatibility interview, and then a full stack interview that was basically a combination of all three.

in the phone interview: - pretty basic python algorithm question. Having read the others here, I assumed I&#039;d get pitched a softball and then a harder question. I was able to solve it within the first several minutes, but spent the rest of the session trying to optimize the solution. - some basic SQL questions on joins and such. I answered probably 5 or 6 questions. Both of these interviews seemed like minimum bar screens. For the in-person interview: - more difficult python question and had to code on a white board. It was a pretty simple sorting question that was easy to solve but less trivial to optimize. - more difficult SQL questions. I struggled here but I was a bit weaker in SQL so I figured as much. This progressed into dashboard design. - Lunch was at a cafe on campus and delicious. Interviewer was just asking me about work experience and culture and it seemed just like a general personality compatibility test. - Full Stack interview was my favorite part and a lot of fun. Without giving too much away, I was given a realistic problem and tasked with conceptualizing the solution in real time, from start to finish, on a white board. It was a mix of coding and conceptual and seemed to be meant to test product sense.   1 Answer

There were 2 Telephonic round(1 coding+1 sql)(45 mins each with a break of 15 mins in between) You will be asked to code. Interviews would start with basic introduction and they would ask you to code in your preferred language(but Python is preferred). sql questions are My sql based. Regular questions but answers expected are the most optimized way. They would expect simple questions to be answered in a particular way.

1) Given a number and a array. Python code to find sum of any 2 numbers in a list is equal to a given number. 2) sql question mostly on case when, joins ex: Q3: delete all dupliactes from a table in one query 3) Mostly the interviewer was cornering me by asking not to use regular ways, so he was expecting the answers in a particular way, ex: can't use joins, sub query etc which made very simple questions tough   Answer Question

Recruiter approached via linkedin and requested for a 30 min chat about my current roles and responsibilities and what are their expectations and probable compensations and benefits.

The interviewer in the first phone screen for SQL was very professional. He explained the questions clearly and clearly defined what he was looking for. Multiple SQL questions were asked.

Facebook's culture of moving fast spills directly into recruiting and the interview process. The recruiters are very reachable and friendly, and provided great technical and cultural preparation for the interview process. I have interviewed with many competitors during my job search but Facebook is always a step ahead, and provided the best attention and service. There were two phone screen interviews that focused mostly on technical programming in working with data that required a SQL and a scripting-language approach to solving the problem. The on-site interview was scheduled with 6 interviewers. The structure of the interview revolved around having 2 Jedi, 2 Ninja, and 2 Pirate interviews. At Facebook, Jedi interviews are mostly based around cultural fit questions, Ninja interviews are based around technical programming skills (in SQL and scripting languages) and Pirate interviews are based around design problems. The interviewers were very friendly and set a comfortable pace for an otherwise tiring and lengthy process. In my experience and opinion, I think they are really looking at potential talent and aptitude, and I was amazed at how sharp some interviewers were in their ability to identify a candidate's lack of experience in the topic and were able to redesign their questions on the spot to better access the candidate. I came out of the interview wanting to work for Facebook even if I was not selected, but thankfully I made it through the process :)

Overall, Facebook's interview process was slow and uncoordinated. I was referred, but dealt with their internal recruiters throughout the process. After chatting with one of their recruiters, I was told they'd schedule an initial screening interview. Since I was local, this was done at their headquarters instead of over the phone. This screening was actually 3 one-on-one interviews and took over two hours. These were pretty basic questions, and none were too difficult. I passed the screen and went back for another round of one-on-one interviews. These questions were tougher. One was about scaling an app I'd written up to Facebook scale. Since I don't have a ton of experience working at scale, I don't know if I flubbed it or not. One was about processing log files of events to determine a user's current status. And one was about splitting strings up using a dictionary (search for "Retiring a Great Interview Problem" if you want the details) that I eventually worked though. After that, I was asked back to a third round of one-on-one interviews. I was told this one would be quick, but it was just as long as the others. Most of the questions were actually about work I'd done previously and data visualization. After this, I received a call from a recruiter who sounded excited, saying they were going to do a background check on me, and that I should expect to hear back when the hiring manager returned from vacation. But that time came and went, and I was eventually told (via email) that the position had been filled, so I didn't get an offer. I'd like to draw special attention to how slow this process was. After my initial contact with a recruiter, it took 2 weeks to schedule and do the screening interview. It took another 2 weeks for them to get feedback and schedule a second round. After the second round, it look another 3 weeks to get the third round scheduled. And then it was another 2 weeks before I heard back. I had nearly wide-open availability, so the only thing holding things up was Facebook. I'd also like to draw attention to how uncoordinated the recruiters were. My initial contact was with one recruiter. After chatting with him, he handed me off to a second recruiter. She scheduled the second interview, after which i was handed off to a third recruiter. And after that, the email saying the position had been filled came from a fourth recruiter. Meanwhile, the recruiters that scheduled the interviews helped escort me around on site were different than any of these. It was very, very difficult to keep track of who to contact with questions, updates, and thank yous. I also think the job title of I was applying for changed at least once during this process, which led to a little confusion in the actual interviews, though all recruiters involved assured me it was the same position. More uncoordination: they asked me to fill out an application form, and I did so and turned it in at my screening interview. They then asked from this same form at every subsequent interview, and even once over email, and I had to keep reminding them I'd already done it. Also, just a gripe. All three of my on-site interviews were scheduled to begin in the morning, and they all lasted well past noon. I was only offered lunch once.

They asked how I'd scale a web app I'd previously developed in my spare time up to Facebook scale.   1 Answer

The recruiters were really nice. They planned well through out the process and communicated so well during the process. But, the callous attitude of interviewers always bothers me. I was asked to show up around 10am and I reached the place 9.45am. But, the interviewer did not show up until 10.40am. No apologies and he did not even feel bad about it. He threw a training book and told me to solve a design/data modeling problem. He himself did not have clue about the answer and he was looking at the answer in the back of the book. He asked random question and manager asked one question thinking as he solved every problem in the earth. That totally put me off.

Took a long time to get through the whole thing, first there's a pre-screening chat with a recruiter, then after about a month I was able to get a screening interview scheduled (followed by a second screening interview a few weeks later) and after all those, I finally was given a full on-site. Overall, it took several months. The recruiters were generous with prep materials, though, and seemed genuinely interested in helping me get through the process.

Signed an NDA, so I can't give specifics, but they had me whiteboard SQL/python/R code that would accomplish some task based on given a database as well as asked business sense types of questions related to that data. There were some fundamental prob/stat questions as well as some frequentist inference. All in all, they seemed to be interested just as much in my ability to communicate as they were in my technical skills.

All around nice people and HR was excellent! At every stage they were clear and transparent. Round 1: phone screening with basic logic questions. Checking that I knew basic probability, dependant and independant, stats concepts. Total time was 15-20 minutes. Round 2: in-person 1:1. Product analytics case study. If we were to add X feature to Facebook, how would you measure if it was a good idea or not? A discussion ensued with each step leading to the next. Total time was an hour. Round 3: a series of 1:1 interviews over the course of a day. Some in person, some video conf. Two case studies like above, 1 math (mostly probability and stat concepts), 1 SQL analysis, 1 SQL ETL. I did not get an offer. HR did call me afterwards and reviewed the feedback from each interview. Super nice folk and I'm ok with their setting a very high bar to enter. Was told that I could check back next year.

The experience of interviewing with Facebook is very positive. The entire process of interview consists of three steps: 1) HR screening: HR briefed on the job and interview process of this position; After screening, HR will provide a bunch of tips and preparation materials for the upcoming online technical interview. However, regardless the relaxed atmosphere, you should be prepared with your answers to some typical behavior questions asked by HR; 2) online technical review: some data manipulation challenges (many similar questions can be found in other glassdoor reviews for the same position), online A/B experiment questions and short analytical questions (I was told that the pass rate of the round of interview is 1/5); From my standpoint, this online interview is mini-version of onsite interview by preliminarily assess the core skill set: statistics, analytical, data manipulation (R/Python/SQL) and product sense. 3) onsite interview: 2 sections on analytics (some reviewer called it product questions), 1 section on Math (not brain teasers), 1 section on technical (in-depth SQL data manipulation and interpretation of sample results; 2 section on SWE (whiteboard coding).

It was a pain to communicate with the recruiter. She seems so busy that does not have time for basics. Took several back-and-forth emails and more than a week to book a 10-min phone screening with her. The email she sent was addressed to another candidate. Despite the available time slots I provided, the technical interview was still scheduled at a time that I wouldn't be available. No biggies after all, but the experience was just frustrating.

The technical interview was tough. I was not expecting another data scientist interviewing me about a hypothetical feature -- a credit card info pop-up. Then, the next part was more of a product development question -- how would one develop the Like, Love, Sad feature. The competitive nature of Facebook work environment seems to be affecting the interview process. Even though the recruiters are generous about giving clues for the prep, the data scientist interviewer came across as arrogant, esp when they found out I did not have a PhD like them.

One HR interview, one takehome data challenge, one shared screen with SQL and one onsite with several 1:1 interviews. They check your coding skills and product sense via the takehome, your sql skills via the shared screen interview and machine learning theory as well as product sense during the onsite. They let you choose the language for the takehome and onsite there is no coding on the board. So you just need to know one language (whichever you want, although I think they prefer R or Python) + SQL. No C++/Java/etc stuff and no CS algo questions.

Data challenge was very similar to the ads analysis challenge on the book the collection of data science takehome challenge, so that was easy (if you have done your homework). SQL was: you have a table where you have date, user_id, song_id and count. It shows at the end of each day how many times in her history a user has listened to a given song. So count is cumulative sum. You have to update this on a daily basis based on a second table that records in real time when a user listens to a given song. Basically, at the end of each day, you go to this second table and pull a count of each user/song combination and then add this count to the first table that has the lifetime count. If it is the first time a user has listened to a given song, you won't have this pair in the lifetime table, so you have to create the pair there and then add the count of the last day.

Pretty straightforward interview process. Both the interviewer and recruiter were very respectful. First had a quick conversation with the HR after which she scheduled me for a phone interview. The interviewer was very courteous and asked me three questions. First question was expected outcome , the other two were SQL based. I think was a little slow in solving the questions, maybe that's why received a rejection ~ also pretty sure that there was a better solution to one of the questions.

Got the interview via internal referral. First step was with the HR. It was mainly to discuss about my interests and to decide which team I should be applying for. It was nice and it felt like HR was genuinely trying to understand what I like to then match me to the appropriate team. After a couple of days I got an email from HR saying I would be interviewing with the Personalization team and that the first step would be to solve a takehome test. I won't describe the challenge, but it is very similar to one that can be found on the book "A Collection of Data Science Takehome challenges". Since I had prepared on that book, I could solve it fairly easily. The next step was onsite interview with team members. The onsite interview was really long and it involved a lot of open ended questions (i.e. how would you do this? what kind of problems do you think you will encounter with this approach? etc.). After you would describe your approach, they would go into details a lot to make sure you actually have a clear idea of how to take the project from start to end. It was a really hard interview, but it is facebook, so it is kinda expected. I got an offer and salary was really high so I was just happy to accept!

Phone screening, then online interview (coding questions), then 4 more onsite interviews ('data science'/modelling interview, another 2 coding interviews, and statistical analysis interview). Some of the interviewers were very kind and nice, some were showoffs and annoying. You are given more chance to show your coding skills than your data analysis/statistics modelling ones, which is a shame.

Screening was basic concepts questions. Coding interview were part live coding in a chat, others on a white board. Things like implement a sparse matrix, or questions from the coding interview book.

I submitted my resume for a data scientist position. After few days a recruiter reached out to me telling me that he would like me to interview for another position in data engineering. It was fine by me to do that since the title itself is not the main goal. The first interview was a screening one and it was easy. It was a very traditional interview, however, the only difference I would think of is that the interviewer asked technical questions during the screening. The second interview was a coding interview. It was a two phase process of programming and databases. The programming part was easy, the question is actually easier than all I prepared for and I was ready for a lot of data structure questions, my code ran successfully but the interviewer seemed bitter about it even though it ran and I did not understand that. The database part also was easy, however, the interviewer was very unclear while describing the question so it took me about ten minutes to understand what does he want. He kept changing his requirements and giving me distracting information. I told him I need to know what does he want in order to write the code. I got the code running but to be honest I did not get it running immediately, it took me another ten minutes. After that I felt like he personally did not like me even though my code ran with no mistakes. The most horrible part is that I stayed waiting two weeks and then I emailed him back. He told me he does not know the decision and told me to reach out to the recruiter. The recruiter told me he forgot to send me an email that I was rejected. Honestly, that was very unprofessional. For these three reasons: 1) When doing a coding interview, you have to expect that the person might make a mistake while writing the code. We are human beings. But if he gets it to work then he knows what he is doing 2) When you set a goal for someone and he makes it, please do not tell him he was not good enough. That puts you in a very embarrassing position 3) When you do an interview with someone, even if he is not up to your mighty standards. Please tell him that he is not up to your class

This is probably one of the worst experience of my life in interviewing for a data scientist position. The recruiter reached out me and asked me to study a laborious list of Python, R, SQL, hive, statistics and probability. The recruiter scheduled the phone interview which they constantly kept rescheduling, very unprofessional ofcourse! The interviewer arrived on to call and started with the word "kool" and asked me to open the coderblock. He didn't even care to ask what my name was. He rushed on to the first interview question and asked me a probability question and i gave the answer within a minute. Pat came the reply! Wrong answer! (Even though it was 100% right answer). The interviewer kept pushing me that my answer was incorrect. And he started suggesting me to proceed in his own way and he consumed almost 25 minutes on this. Then he asked me a basic SQL question which he tried to complicate it by not providing the list of values in the table and just complicating that it is tough question. He kept changing his stance on how a record looks and what is the unique key. Then he asked me do you have any questions. He tried to act "kool" as if he has invented the world. I asked him what tools do you use? He kept saying we use hive, python etc and tried to act like he was "uber" cool. I would strongly recommend not to go forward with the recruiting process as you will probably waste your valuable time.

I came in contact with Facebook employees at a conference and was invited to a recruiting event the next evening. I originally had a phone screen with a recruiter for a position that was too technical for me, but she was still interested in me and encouraged me to check out other jobs listed on the site. I did find the Data Scientist position fit my qualifications, and let her know. From that point, the process took about 3 weeks. After another recruiter screen for the second position, I had a technical phone screen and was then invited to fly down to Menlo Park for an in-person interview. I was definitely challenged in the in-person interview with fairly difficult math, probability, statistics, and SQL questions. I wasn't able to solve every problem, but they are mostly interested in how you think about it and how far you get. I did email the solution the next day for the one I didn't completely solve. The recruiters did prepare me fairly well for what to expect, and I enjoyed that the interview was almost exclusively technical. No 'tell me about a time when...' questions.

Facebook has two data science teams, the "core" team (which is the one featured in various news stories), and the product/growth team. I interviewed for the product side, so a core data science interview might be substantially different. From my experience, I get the sense that "data scientist" on the product side is a misnomer, and they are more of the business analysts; while the "core" team is similar to other data science teams in the bay area. The first interview is a phone screen (or on-site if you're local). They asked a few SQL and probability questions, and it was over in ~30 minutes. My interviewer was friendly and enthusiastic, and the questions weren't particularly difficult. The second interview was on-site, and involved talking with 5 different people (or groups of people). Each interviewer had a specific task they were asking about, including business analytics/product health questions, stats/probability theory, algorithms, and more SQL. The questions weren't particularly hard or out of left field but they're looking for you to answer confidently and efficiently. The people were overwhelmingly friendly and tended to be enthusiastic about working for Facebook (although, at least 2 of my interviewers subtly admitted they were casually looking for jobs - so, I suspect even employees at Facebook aren't 100% fulfilled by their positions).

I was surprised that there were no machine learning or data mining questions, or any personality/experience ("tell me about a time when you...") questions. The more technical questions were things that a graduating CS student would succeed at, but did not involve principles that you would actually use in practice in a data role at a company. Also, make sure you continue working on a problem until you've provided the most efficient solution you think you can. I stopped after I had a working solution, and indicated to the interviewer that I don't think it's the most efficient solution. The interviewer said it was fine and we moved on to another question. Nonetheless, the biggest piece of feedback I got from the recruiter afterwards is that I didn't provide a solution that was sufficiently efficient.   Answer Question

Facebook reached out to me via... a facebook message. I wasn't actively looking, but decided to go through the interview process because why not? Maybe they could offer me something my current employer couldn't. The interview process started with two phone interviews. The first was just information and some fact checking. The second was a bit more technical and I had to show the ability to code and answer statistical questions online as one (or more) people watched me type. Then they flew me out for a day/night and I went through 5 interviews in a row (30 minutes each). Facebook has a beautiful Menlo Park campus. Throughout the interviews, only one simple bayesian stats question was asked. Everything else was business questions and computer science questions. I think my training is much more stats/machine learning oriented, so I struggled with a few questions. I signed a NDA, so I can't disclose the exact questions. They asked me on optimal algorithms, standard SQL coding, and business problems. It was very interesting and they did a good job letting me work through things on my own. I think they were looking for someone with more computer science/programming experience than I had.

Again, I can't talk about the specific question, but after I wrote up a simple algorithm, the interviewer asked me for a more efficient solution. I really struggled with that.   Answer Question

I was first contacted by a sourcer for a different position, but the recruiter that she connected me to never replied my email. A few months passed, I received an offer from another company so I thought I'd check in with the recruiter again. He emailed back, but ultimately the position he was recruiting for wasn't a good fit. He passed me to a second recruiter, who's super efficient in terms of both scheduling and getting back to me with the results. It took him literally less than 24 hours from the beginning of my interview to get me a verbal offer. Super impressive. For the onsite, there were 5 back-to-back 30-min interviews. It was quite intense, and a lot of talking. They should've fit a 5 min break here and there, but oh well. There's a few algorithm questions, stats, design, research background, etc.

It was all a blur to me now. I don't think there was anything too difficult in particular, but lots of talking and have to focus since all interviews were back-to-back.   Answer Question

For those of you who (like me) have no idea what that means, it means a tiny bit of coding/scripting in a language of your choice while you work a reasonable, made-up data science scenario. They'll give you pretend access to a pretend database of information, have you write a few queries, give you fake data for your output, and have you debug plausible scenarios for that fake data. I received word rather quickly (two days later) that I passed the phone screen and would be invited to Mountain View for a day of interviews. I scheduled those interviews for 3 weeks down the line. Interviews at Mountain View are grueling, not because of their technical difficulty, but rather because of the interview setup. I was interviewed in a tiny closed cubicle no more than 8 feet x 8 feet; room for two one-seater couches and a tiny table. The wall was a whiteboard. There were 5 back to back 30 minute interviews, and while the interviewers were apparently supposed to ask if I needed water or a bathroom break, they often forgot to do so. The next interviewer was waiting right outside when the last interview ended. After we covered all of the technical content (about which I signed an NDA, so I unfortunately will not share the details of that), I had about 120 seconds to quiz my interviewer about what data science is like at Facebook. I may have earned brownie points with one on-site interviewer for stopping him when he started asking me the same question that I had had during my phone screen. He thanked me and changed to a new problem. I studied for the Data Scientist interviews by: a) coding in python (which I do for my job; they were happy to let me code in python for the on-site interviews) b) reviewing Stanford's online statistics 101 class c) doing a few 'hat trick' type probability puzzles I was well prepared for their interview questions. I heard back from my recruiter 1 week after on-site interviews and received a generous offer with a fungible 2-week acceptance deadline.

This was a very long process. However the recruitment team was extremely helpful in keeping me completely informed at every step of the way (a huge plus). As a disclaimer, coming from years of working in academic settings I have no point of comparison. These are just my personal impressions. I was introduced to a recruiter after one of our students started working at Facebook. He was very prompt in getting back to me and setting up a phone call. He then passed my resume to another recruiter (closer to my area of expertise). Over the next few weeks, I had a number of phone conversations with different people (mostly analytic, coding and statistics type questions.) The recruiter working with me was very prompt in touching base with me after each interview, telling me how they felt about the interview and getting my feedback on how I felt about it. After a few weeks they flew me to Menlo Park for an on site interview. The on site interview consisted of a series of five 30-minute interviews with project managers, data scientists and software engineers, all of whom were very engaging and interesting people. Talks were 1/4 about my current work, a bit less than 3/4 technical questions they expected me to work through, and a few minutes of time for my questions about the company, its people and processes. The recruiter reached out to me after the on site interview and scheduled two more phone interview, and an offer was made shortly after the last phone interview.

Nothing unexpected, mostly because they will tell you in detail what to expect in each interview. Coding on a collaborative text editor while doing a phone interview was new to me. I had a lot of typos, and syntax errors the first time I tried it. I'd recommend doing a practice run with a friend just so one gets used to the set up.   Answer Question

Applied online and got an email the next day from an HR staff member. 1) Screening call with HR staff - just asking about my work experience and motivation for applying. Straightforward. The HR person gave me some information about the position, and plenty of information about how to prepare for the later interviews (below). 2) Preliminary interview (can choose to either do on-site 1:1 or phone with online shared-document for coding). I went on-site. My interviewer asked a series of basic stats questions (if X1 and X2 are normally distributed (and IID) with mu, sigma, and Y=X1+X2, what is the mean and s-dev of Y?). Then basic binomial stats question - I got a little tripped up due to the nervousness, but it wasn't bad. Then he asked me to conceptually explain how I'd check if two numbers in an array sum to X. Then asked for the algorithm's time-complexity, and then asked if I could do better. Eventually he asked me to code up the faster version on the white-board. He said that he was recommending that I come for the on-site interview despite my having a bit of difficulty here and there. Nice of him to give me the benefit of the doubt. And he gave me more details about the final interview process... At this point I got passed from the screening HR person to another one, and at the same time I got another job offer so I asked to accelerate the process. They were very accommodating, which was really nice. Final interview was scheduled for 3 business days later and I was told I'd know if I was going to receive an offer the same day as my final interview! About as quick a turn-around as I can imagine them doing. Very helpful. 3) Final on-site interview consists of 5 quick meetings (30min each) with different analytics team members and one Product Manager. Was coding on the white-board in 3/5 of the interviews. First one was dynamic/recursive programming focused (Python). Second one was database insight focused (SQL) that began with a description of a SQL table and a new feature and then asking what metrics you'd look at to diagnose the health of the feature/product. Then write those queries. He told me what numbers I would have seen from those queries, and then asked me what that would imply to me, and then he had me do another few queries to diagnose what might be giving the skewed numbers he'd given me. Third one started with a straight-forward Bayesian stats question (I realized it was most amenable to the Bayesian approach after flailing with frequentist stuff for a minute), then we moved to a few questions about Recommendation systems and any intuition I had around those. Fourth one started with an explanation of a "new feature" and a graph of adoption rates, then asked me to explain to a non-technical person what the graph meant/implied. Asked for any ideas I had around why the graph might be shaped the way it was. Last one was with a Product Manager who asked what products I was interested in - a few probing questions to make sure I'd done some homework on those products. Then some A/B testing questions where he explained another change they'd made to one of their products and asked me how I'd decide if that was a good change or not. Then some questions about how I'd diagnose why something wasn't working as expected. I felt like I did well - but I didn't nail the questions right away. I got the answers, but I'd bet that I flailed a bit too much on-route for the interviewers' tastes. Sort of a shame since I see a little bit of flailing around as an important part of the creative problem-solving process, but I could understand how it wouldn't inspire confidence in someone who already knows the answer and is just waiting for you to get there. And maybe they just want people who know all the answers already or never get challenged by anything. In any case, the whole experience was very professionally handled. I was very impressed by the transparency of their process. I had seen the Glassdoor interview feedback from a few unhappy previous interviewees and it was clear that (at least in my case) the HR team had seen the same complaints and had corrected things as much as they could. I was impressed - definitely a good interview experience.

This was for the data scientist/business analytics role. a little background on me: I just received my bachelors. I do not know if what I say will necessarily be applicable to people in a different situation. Starting from the beginning: I applied cold with my resume through their website. Then there was an optional coding question. Pro tip: Do it. The question was a bit more difficult than your average weed out question. The question was a game theory - esque question, e.g. "given these rules of a game and a starting point, tell me whether player 1 or player 2 will win". They gave me 2 hours for the question. I spent about 45 minutes thinking/writing code (final solution was about 25 lines of python code, the idea was the tricky part), then 15 minutes commenting code and trying to make it look pretty. Another pro tip: The question is timed. try to finish as fast as possible while still giving a solid solution/explanatory comments. Within a few days (maybe one or two) I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter to set up a a phone or 1:1 onsite interview, I opted for the phone interview. The recruiters are awesome/responsive. If they're not responding they're likely in meetings, don't fret. You will be talking with the recruiters quite a bit. They set up phone calls with you (not interviews) just to get a sense of who you are throughout the process. Be friendly and convey your excitement. The phone interview: It was not crazy difficult for me. There's obviously no hard tips I can give you aside from 1) try not to let the phone go silent, always be telling them what you're thinking about, even while writing code. Justify it line by line, this way if you mess up along the way they can point it out before you dig the hole too deep. Then again, don't expect them to point out every error you make. 2) Expect a mathematical question. It won't be some stupid straight coding question like "reverse the words in this string". This interview was a while ago, but i'll try to recall the general structure of it. They ask you some sql like query questions. I didn't know sql, so I answered in python. They asked me to code the question in a shared doc, then after I got the right solution they asked me to answer (verbally) a mathematical elaboration of that question. This elaboration lead into a discussion, and then questions from my end. Soon after I was asked to come in for an onsite interview. It was a greet with my recruiter, then 5 interviews with no break for lunch (which I would recommend). The interviews were a lot of fun. It was 2-3 data science type of people, a product manager, and a staff data scientist. I signed an NDA so I can't tell you what they asked me but the recruiter will tell you the general type of questions they ask. Some questions involved writing code, some didn't. All of them felt like a discussion. (e.g. I offer an important component about answering the question, and they say "but what about this case where your component doesn't help?" and you iterate.) They work heavily with sql, but they don't count it against you if you don't know it. Use whatever language you feel most comfortable in. Tips: Don't be nervous. Smile, I can't say this enough. If you act like you're being shot at it will make the process painful. I even made a few jokes and so did my interviewers. Don't be afraid to laugh, this isn't an interrogation. If you're excited about the job, they'll be able to tell. Don't beat around the bush/avoid questions. I had 10 minutes left in an interview and my interviewer asked if I wanted to stop and ask him questions, I said "no, I like your questions, let's keep going". That kind of excitement will shine through and make the interview feel natural. Just keep calm and keep it conversational. Ask for clarification on a question if you're even slightly unclear about the problem. Try to keep talking/express what you're thinking during the entire process. Also, be creative, they're looking for that. Most importantly, try to honestly convey your passion/excitement for the job. These guys love their job and want to see that you will too. That being said, don't fake it. Your interviewers are ridiculously smart so you won't be able to fool them. Good luck!

They honestly give you a good feel for the types of questions they'll be asking. No surprises. "Most difficult" is so subjective it's meaningless in this context. I hope you're good at math/computer science. If you've had some meaningful machine learning experience, you'll be set.   Answer Question

I heard they were interested in physicists so I applied online and heard from a recruiter within a week. The initial phone interview included a few technical questions but it seemed more like a "cultural fit" screening. They want enthusiasm! We set up an interview on the FB campus a week and a half later. I received an email at 12:30am the morning before my interview with "interview tips". I had no idea what I was getting into and would have needed to study for a few weeks in order to brush up on CS concepts I haven't addressed since undergrad. Went to the interview completely unprepared. As much as they advertise that they want physicists they did not ask any questions, or offer me any time, to ascertain how my experience and skill set may apply to the position. They really just wanted a code jockey. While I have coding experience, it was not sufficient for the position. This is understandable but should have been made clear in the initial screening so as not to waste either parties time. Everyone was nice but very unorganized.

The interviewing process was disorganized and unprofessional. i first received an email from a Recruiter from the Product Analysis team. After a screening on the phone, they set me up with a technical interview with a Data Scientist to assess my Python skills. First, the Data Scientist scheduled didn't show up to my interview. They had a replacemen who I could tell did not want to be there. Aside from cursing in the interview, he was the kind of guy who nitpicked at code that was functionally the same but not the way he would write it. An example would come to mind is using if/else vs. if/elif. At the end of the interview, I have never seen anyone try to get off the phone as fast as him. It ended like "I gotta go" "Ok" "Click." That ended with a rescheduled phone interview because I wasn't assessed any of my skills. The second phone interview went well, but because I didn't use SQL and insisted on using python they decided i "am a better fit for BI." Well this is the part of the process that angered me enough to write this review. They transferred me to the BI recruiter who had a screening with me. Keep in mind we are now at 4 phone interviews. He tells me he will set up a phone interview early next week. One week and 2 emails pass by and he is completely missing in action. No response to any way I try to contact him.  If I have one pet peeve with Recruiters is when they lie to and/or ignore candidates. In my experience with Facebook, I had both.

Submitted resume through employee referral. Received call from recruiter about three weeks later. After initial phone screen with recruiter set up phone interview with two people there (back to back 30 minute one on one interviews). One of the interviews was on analytics - a statistics questions and measuring the performance of their products. The other was technical, involved sorting list. Like 8 days later, recruiter got back in touch with me saying they were going to bring me on-site for an interview. They set up a flight and hotel room for me. On-site was five one-on-one 30 minute interviews. Two technical, two analytics, and one on product. Really seemed interested in how I would measure performance of Facebook products and use data to identify problems. Interviews set up to run from 9:00am - 11:30am. They just grabbed me from the lobby at 8:45, put me in a room that the interviewers came to, then dropped me back off in the lobby after the last interview without showing me around at all. Friend came down to get me afterwards to give me a tour and grab lunch. Recruiter said would let me know decision within 2 days but no news til 8 days later. Didn't get an offer. Overall, experience was pretty good though the recruiting staff seemed overworked and often missed their own deadlines.

I have a PhD in computational neuroscience / psychology. The Data Scientist position looked perfect for me because of my interest fitting models to large datasets describing human behavior. The HR person was nice. The interviewer was someone from the data science team-- nice and very young. He had me go up to the white board and write C++ code to answer a few questions. As a PhD, I was expecting research type questions, not coding. So I got a bit nervous. I didn't fully understand all of his questions and he helped me. I left feeling kind of annoyed. It probably wasn't the right job for me because I am not a software engineer.

The recruiter mailed me and wanted to know my interest in FB. He possibly found my email ID from a Programming Contest Site. It was a surprise mail because the same recruiter wanted to speak to me a year back, but never called despite scheduling times on three occasions. But this time he did call and set me up for a Phone Interview. I got passed two Phone interviews, as I was scheduled for a third one. Few days after the third, I get a thank you mail from them saying I don't have the right skill for the positions that's open now. Since I got the bad news after the third interview, I would mention that one in a bit more detail. He called on time. He knew that I got passed two rounds and then for quite some time we discussed about the kind of things done in FB. He reminded me that he is in a very responsible position and is the right man to ask for in depth question about FB. His overall attitude was friendly. After the talking, he asked me two coding question and I had to code on Collabedit. The problem difficulties were easy, but after coding he asked me to improve on certain section of the code. There was also a requirement that the code must compile. Now, I was typing on an Web Based editor without any compile option and I am not sure if its considered a big skill to have the code compile on first type. From my part, I would say I did well if not excellent. They mentioned they would consider me when posts open up. Not sure if this is how they mail out Reject mails, or they are considering my positive aspects of passing two phone rounds.

Watch out, this company flies you out and takes care of the hotel, but they don't mention ground transportation, and you get stuck with a pretty hefty bill if you don't know your way around. As for the interview, they send a lot of mixed messages - the website states that you should dress business for the interview, but I was dissed by one of the staff for doing exactly that (I was overdressed!). In general, I found a lack of mature, objective questions and comments from some of the interview team, who were more interested if I fit in than whether I could do the job. It felt like I was back in high school and I was expected to be cool enough to be allowed into the "A" group.

Initial Chat - 3 basic JS questions ---> difference between == and === , difference between block and inline and I forgot the third Calendar challenge (as the others have said there's a challenge). I too think this was the most difficult. Then on-site. I heard a lot of good things about their interview process on-site, but I felt like mine wasn't that great. I had 3 interviews back-to-back without breaks. I didn't get a tour or a meal... I also received no feedback, just that my whiteboard code wasn't clean (Um you should be quick, if you fail 1 interview you fail .. period). My recruiter was great. You can tell she tried. They called me a few days later telling me I didn't meet the requirements. BIGGEST TIP: Go through all the questions on Glassdoor and CareerCup, code on paper not on your laptop!

Process began via a phone call from a recruiter. Recruiter took down a few biographic details including education and work history, and then promised a follow-up soon. I was sent a coding puzzle, which I completed in a couple days and sent back. A few days later, I confirmed a phone interview via email. A week after the phone interview, the recruiter called back and told me they'd like to bring me on site for one of their "university days" which included a bunch (it varies - I had 3) back-to-back interviews, each about 45 minutes long, followed by lunch, and a tour. About a week after that, I was told of my final result via email. It's possible the recruitment team could have worked faster; I just decided to play it slow and make more deliberate moves.

The most difficult question was the initial puzzle, which is a sizeable project. The phone interview was mainly focused on Javascript DOM tree manipulation. On-site questions included a few quick algorithms questions (flatten an array), design/code a poll widget. All of the questions were heavy on JS, which is expected for this position.

First phone screening included couple of Javascript Questions about functions you can perform on strings. Also CSS related questions like difference between block and inline. Followed by a kind of homework to build a layout for a calendar where events added on the calendar that collide in time can't visually collide but should take same width with the events that they collide in time with. After that another 45 minutes interview that was a chat on my previous projects and why I wanted to work for facebook plus 2 Javascript question on Collabedit.

Had a connection who linked me up with a recruiter. Whole process took about 2 months. Started with an initial phone screen followed by a coding challenge. Interviewed in person at a branch office, then they flew me out for an on site interview. They flew me all the way out from the midwest for a 40 minute interview that the guy was 10 minutes late for. We ran out of time halfway through me answering one of the questions which I guess is why I didn't get the internship. Kinda sucks cuz I was really on track to answer it correctly but it's their loss. Liked the free trip though.

The process was very quick and efficient, and took about 4 weeks, as far as I remember. The recruiter (Facebook's own employee) was very good, kept me updated on the process throughout the different interviews etc. The same for the phone interviews, they really know their stuff. The on-site interviewers were friendly, engaged in the interviews (except one, she was working on her laptop during the session) and they want you to succeed, it definitely feels like they are on your side. The entire interview process was a very positive experience. I might apply again another time.

A recruiter approached me through email. I had a quick online interview with typical HR questions (experience, why would you like to join, etc) and 4 very simple technical questions. The interviewer was very polite and explained the entire process. Afterwards, I received a coding challenge via email and was given 3 weeks to complete it. The interviewer garanteed I could take my time. I completed it in something like 10 hours over the span of 1 week and a half (busy week at work) and delivered the results pretty confident that I wrote clean code, with tooling, comments and even specs. After that, in half a day I received a single "no" with zero feedback. I suspect they are not measuring your ability to solve the problem, but something else, as it was pretty much solved perfectly... Anyways, I was saddened by the lack of feedback - as others pointed out, if we gave them hours of time, they could at least point what was missing.

The coding challenge was confidential. The first technical questions were very basic JavaScript, though.   Answer Question

Started with an internal HR phone screen after I submitted my cv on Facebook's career website. Then typical 2 tech phone screens before I was taken to the Facebook HQ. Interviewers and HRs were all very nice, smart and passionate. I felt I had done not too bad on the on-site interview, even though I did need quite help from the interviewers and the code on the whiteboard was definitely not beautiful. The feedback turned out that I wasn't so good to get into the UI/UX team. One week after the on-site interview, I was arranged for another interview over the phone with a different team, but it's totally not my area, so it's not surprising it got busted. Generally very good experience, very nice and helpful HR people and excited to be able to visit Facebook campus.

A recruiter emailed me then scheduled a brief preliminary phone call. They asked about my experience and why I'd be interested in working at Facebook and explained the recruitment process. The next day I was sent a front-end coding puzzle/challenge to complete, which took about 10 hours. Given a set of boxes with fixed vertical dimensions I had to implement a JavaScript algorithm that lays them out according to some specifications. A phone interview was scheduled about a week after completing the puzzle. I spoke with a front-end engineer and coded through a few HTML/CSS/JS questions using a shared document. My thought process was emphasized more than getting syntactically-correct answers, as long as I could explain what I was trying to do. The next day I was told I would move on to the next phase and was flown to California about 2 weeks later. The in-person interview consisted of 4 45-minute interviews, each of which were similar to the phone interview. We talked a bit about why I would like to work at Facebook and wrote code on a whiteboard. I was asked to write how I would implement visual UI features, array search/mutation algorithms, and JS performance functions. Throughout the process the recruiters were quick to reply to my emails and open to any questions I had. However after I was told I didn't get an offer they stopped being that helpful and couldn't offer me a way to obtain feedback about my interviews.

I applied for another position two months prior to being contacted about another position the recruiter felt I was more suited. The phone interview was typical recruiter conversation (CV, languages, types of projects, why I wanted to work at Facebook). I was then asked to complete a code exercise in JS or PHP. It involved sorting and arranging overlapping events on a day calendar like iCal. While I easily complete the exercise and accommodated for all stated and unstated event scenarios, I was told that Facebook was no longer interested after reviewing my code. I was quite surprised and requested additional feedback, but they did not provide it. I gave them several hours of my time to complete their test. The least they could have done was give me 10 more minutes of theirs.

It was a phone interview. The interviewer started with telling me something about his team. The he asked questions about my resume and the projects that I did before. Then he asked me to do a monte carlo simulation and asked me to code the simulation over the phone. The question was not too difficult, but given that we only had 30 minutes in total, it was a little bit rush for me. He told me I could choose any language, and I chose to write the code in R. But he seemed to be not very familiar with R . I do not know why we did not use the coderpad. Coding over the phone is not very efficient. The interviewer seems to be in a rush. Usually the last part is to ask the interviewer questions, but he said we ran out of time and hung up the phone without letting me ask questions.

Groups should not contain duplicates. Two words are anagrams if you can turn one into the other by just rearranging the letters. Example: Input: ["star", "rats", "star", "car", "arc", "arts"] Output: [["star", "rats", "arts"], ["car", "arc"]] Q2) Write a function that, given n integer intervals [a_i, b_i] on the real axes, where the absolute value of the coordinates is bounded by M, returns a point that belongs to the maximum number of intervals. Point x belongs to the interval [a, b] iff a <= x <= b.

It started when Facebook visited my University in April. They had a company presentation and offered an online programming challenge for people interested in either an internship or a full time position. After successfully completing the challenge Facebook got back to me in the end of September. For some reason I didn't have to do the HR interview, but had the first technical interview instead. This went well, so I had another one. Unfortunately this didn't work out as good as the first one, so that in the end they decided against hiring me.

Two phone interviews. First was with an engineer and I coded a few problems on a shared coding site and answered some questions about my resume. He questioned one of my answers and seemed to get annoyed, but apologized after I proved to him my answer was correct. Second was more or less the same thing except he skipped the behavioral part. Few days after that, I got an offer. I would just recommend doing LeetCode practice. Questions weren't too difficult, but they're looking for quick thinking.

Questions are standard algorithmic questions. Maybe medium level on LeetCode.   Answer Question

University recruiter called me for an internship. She set the interview quickly with an engineer. The first interview was ok, IT related stuff, DNS, databases.

I applied online and was contacted several weeks later. The recruiter was very nice and took into consideration my deadlines when scheduling an interview. During the actual interview I was asked a simple question. Admittedly, I struggled more than I should have. However, the interviewer grew unnecessarily frustrated and would often sigh loudly. This made it even harder for me to code or explain my code. I did eventually get the right code and time/space complexities. It was obvious about half way through that I was not going to be moving forward and I got the email the next day. What I have to say about the interview is that the question itself is not challenging but they expect you to be able to code it and explain it to near perfection.

My interview was conducted with a software engineer (my college Alum), and it was conducted in an private room, with two tech questions and coding on the board. I (sadly) don't remember the second question since I didn't have enough time to even solve it, but the first question was quite clear.

The interviewer keep sneezing, and I cannot understand what she said clearly at first time. The interview lasted 45 mins and extended 10 min to ask and answer questions. The interviewer was not responsive, so it is hard to communicate with during coding. After I explained my algorithm, I just start to code, and she said nothing or said "OK" when I was speaking. She would not give you any hint of how to solve the bug, just letting you stuck on it. So be careful on each character you type and your logic.

Prepared a lot for the interview and I found the best solution possible to the problem given (O(n) time and O(1) space) and still did not make it to second round. This confirms the "getting the best solution does not guarantee a good interview" myth and you still have to focus on preparing good test cases and overall keeping your interviewer engaged in what you're thinking.

I don&#039;t remember all the questions, but they were all very simple and classic (mostly ad hoc algorithms, not something very complicated) + implement + analyze complexity. One of the questions was: You are given a string which has characters (not spaces) and spaces. Remove consecutive spaces with best complexity; For example, for the string &#034;---ABC--ef--fh--&#034; (I used &#034;-&#034; to replaces spaces, for better visibility), your answer should be &#034;-ABC-ef-fg-&#034;   1 Answer

Such a stellar, stellar process. I was floored by how efficient and enjoyable every step was. I applied through an employee referral after meeting several employees at a conference. Because of NDA, I will remain pretty vague here--but several months later, they began looking for fall interns and a university recruiter contacted me saying she had received my CV through an earlier referral. A week later, we had a 40-minute phone interview (essentially a prescreening on what you're looking for, what experience you'd like to have, why Facebook, and most particularly what your research entails). Three days later, I found out I'd moved on to the next stage. Two weeks later, I had a 50-minute Skype interview that was based on behavioral questions, more about my research, and a few curveball questions that make you think much more deeply about research and methodology. I found out that day that I'd moved on to the last stage. Two weeks after that, Facebook flew me out for an on-site interview. Keeping this as vague as possible, I will say that they were so incredibly gracious and did so much to make sure I had a good experience (it would be hard not to!). Everyone I met was awesome, the campus is fantastic, and everything was incredibly efficient. Expect a presentation on a surprise prompt (you have three days to prepare) and one-on-one interviews. When I left, I realized that even if I didn't get this, just the experience of that single day made everything worth it. Good luck!

NDA, but prepare for basic behavioral questions. For most, there is no right or wrong answer...they just want to see how you think, so as long as you're transparent with how you arrive at your conclusions, it opens the door for interesting conversation. My interviewers were awesome, and that seems to be a pretty normal aspect of Facebook employees. If you go on site, make sure to visit the Facebook store on the main campus (not the new one) and pick up an $11 t-shirt. (:   Answer Question

I sent my resume to a recruiter. They were coming to my university, so I had two interviews with two different engineers in-person. Before it, I had a pre-screen interview by phone with the recruiter and then I scheduled the interviews. Each interview was 45 minutes and it was basically: a description about the interviewer job, an overview in my resume, two average algorithm problems and then questions to the interviewer. In the problems, I gave all the possible solutions, starting by the easiest one. In one of them I didn't see a way, but the interview gave me a hint and it was fine. After three weeks I was called to another 45 minutes interview by Skype. In this interview I got stuck in an easy problem and three days later I got my result by email.

In the first interview, it was two questions: Given a tree, how do you print all the elements by levels? Given a rectangular grid with letters, search if some word is in the grid.   1 Answer In the second interview: given a vector, remove 0 elements.

The interviewer asked me to interleave two linked list - a simple problem, but I missed an edge case, then panicked a bit. The second task involved writing a simple regex parser (with ".", "*" and "?"). This really killed me.

The interview process was kind of long, initial tech screening, online technical interview using coderpad and a couple of Skype calls with engineers. Then finally the onsite interview which consisted of 4 sessions: - Jedi Session - talking about your previous work and where you want to go in the industry/at Facebook. - Pirate Sesion - General application architecture. - 2 X Ninja Sessions - Each session had 2 coding questions in them. All in all, a good process if not a little stretched out depending on when they are doing the onsite interviews.

- Convert a string into an integer without using the inbuilt frameworks. - Given a binary encoded string, find the range of all consecutive 1's and use them to draw an arc. - Given an array of numbers write a method that moves non-zero elements to the front of the array and returns the count of non-zero elements. - Draw up and implement a linked list interface that prints out a description recursively.

I recently completed a full interview sequence with Facebook and thought it would be useful to recap it all for the next candidates coming down the pipeline. The way your interviewing experience starts is with a technical phone screen which lasts for about an hour. If you pass that you'll be invited out to Menlo Park. My interviewing day started at 9:45 a.m. and officially finished at 2 p.m. (but I didn't actually leave until closer to 3 p.m.). The recruiters are very upfront about what happens in the interview -- the initial "jedi" session which is a combination culture-fit and a supposed "easy" coding question, two "ninja" sessions which are in-depth coding / algorithm exercises (which I've recapped below), and one "pirate" session which is an architecture & design session. In terms of difficulty, I felt that the questions were relatively fair. They weren't as relentlessly challenging & tricky as what I've encountered at a traditional Google interview. but none of them were a particularly easy walk through the park. My own personal performance was probably negatively impacted by the stuffiness of the tiny interview room (of course adjusting the thermostat didn't seem to make a difference) and my general nerves (which are always in panic mode every time I'm doing these hard core technical screenings). On the flip side, I was really impressed with the working environment for employees, such as thoughtful touches such as all bathrooms being stocked with thoughtful & useful items (toothbrushes & paste, feminine care items, etc.), The campus is on the shores of San Francisco Bay, so depending on the weather (or the drought) you might be getting a view of water or of a marshy field. I have a feeling that commute times to campus can be frustratingly long, depending on where you live in the Bay Area. If you are able to handle whatever commute you end up having to do, the split campus *IS* a gorgeous and inspiring place. I say "split campus" because there's two different Facebook campuses on both sides of Highway 84. The older campus is on the East side, and the reason it feels like direct copy of the Downtown Disney mall in Anaheim is because it was done that way on purpose. The newer West building is a massive showpiece designed by Frank Gehry, and after my 5 hour interview party was over with, I was able to do a 10-15 minute walk around the beautiful rooftop gardens there with the recruiter. Weirdly enough, aside from a "how do you think you did?" follow-up from one of the recruiters a couple days after the interviewing day, I never heard anything back from anyone. In other words, it's been over a month and I never got the official rejection e-mail or phone call. My guess is the recruiters either lost track of me (which seems strange because they were so on top of arrangements prior to the interview) or they extended offers to one wave of candidates and let other "runner-up" candidates dangle while the first wave made decisions. That was really the only process hiccup along the way. Hopefully my experience flunking the Facebook interview will help you to prepare to pass your interviewing day. If you find any of the information in my interview review helpful, please let me know by voting "Yes" on the "Helpful?" question below (this helps to motivate me to be as detailed as possible).

I had an initial phone screen with him where he asked about my experience and asked me some simple iOS SDK questions. About a week later, I had a technical phone interview with one of their engineers. He asked me more advanced iOS SDK questions. The third interview was on site. It was about a 5 hour process and I had 5 different interviews with 7 different people. The engineers were really cool and easy to talk to, but the whole white boarding process is not my favorite.

Similar to some others, I first got a LinkedIn message from a Facebook HR staff based in India. We scheduled the first phone interview, which is a simple quiz with 5 multiple choice questions, conducted by the HR staff. Afterwards, I had the 2nd and 3rd interview with Facebook iOS engineers, different people but the format is pretty much the same. Each is about 45 min to 1 hour, asked me to do live coding on coderpad.io. I progressed and Facebook flied me from Sydney to Silicon Valley for a face to face interview. It's from 10am-3pm. Touched on many areas including behavioural questions, iOS app architecture, write code on whiteboard, time and space complexity, etc. I did not get an offer in the end but very impressed by the process.

Onsite interview constisted of four more sessions, mostly of them writing code on a whiteboard, one "culture fit" and one design interview.

I was shocked by how unprofessional the process was. My recruiter from the beginning was super flaky. They would not call me when they said they would and then call at completely random times catching me off guard. I appreciated that they tried to help me prepare for interviews, though, which they don't really "have" to do. Then, after the on site, they basically told me I had to commit to coming to Facebook before I would receive an offer. It basically seemed like the recruiter didn't want to go through the effort of filling out paper work if I wasn't going to come. This was pretty shocking after having spent a month jumping through all the hoops and spending basically a whole day on their campus for interviews. I was already leaning slightly toward another company and that really clinched my decision. Then when I told the recruiter I wasn't going to come they got really aggressive contacting me repeatedly over call/text/email trying to get me to change my mind. Still without giving me anything in writing! I was so shocked that a company with the reputation Facebook had would operate that way.

I was referred by a former colleague, and was immediately contacted by the recruiter, who was extremely nice. He asked 20 basic questions involving coding, networking and systems. Then there were 3 phone interviews, each technical, consisting of coding, systems, and networking. The coding interview was straight forward and it was clear that this was a skill that is necessary, but not as important as the others. The systems interview was where I personally had the biggest issue. Not because of the material, but because of the content, and interviewer. The interviewer was the stereotypical Silicon Valley Nerd bully who even warned me before we started that he comes of "a little d*uchey." The moment he said that I knew that the interview was not going to go well. He would not clarify ANY of his questions, he would assume that my sub questions revealed lack of understanding or knowledge. The questions were ridiculous, down to how certain flag options affect the output of certain commands. I understand that a production engineer must know these details, but it is extremely stupid and unrealistic to think that these details cannot be looked up. Long story short, I feel like they didnt even test how much I actually knew about how Linux actually works, just how to look for certain arcane items that vary from distro to distro. Following this disaster, I was informed by the recruiter that they were "not able to offer me the position", as well as "not able to share feedback." Very bitter taste in someones mouth that had been studying and preparing for weeks, sometimes at the expense of my current job, just to be told "no" with zero accountability as to why. Oh wait, but there is more. After a long weekend of sadness and self reflection, I was called again by the recruiter, to say that "they actually want to continue the process to the networking interview, due to the fact that there are many PE teams that deal a lot more with networking than with systems." Naturally, I was ecstatic, seeing as how I am currently in the networking field, and would be able to crush any interview regarding networking. The networking interview came along, which I aced completely. I was contacted the next day, told that they were "not able to offer me the position" and "not able to share feedback"... again. Very weird and ridiculous considering the fact that they called me specifically to test my networking knowledge, only to ask super basic networking questions, have me get them right, then tell me no, and waste yet another week of my time and energy. The Recruiter at facebook was fantastic, the overall experience was not. All of the interviewers were fantastic, except for the systems one. All it takes is one egomaniac that thinks only the worthy should have the chance to work alongside them.  Big attractive companies get away with lack of accountability in the interview process, and literally do not care at all about providing legitimate reasons as to why they think you cant do a job that you know you can do.

Possibly the best recruiting I have ever encountered. The feedback and knowing if you passed to the next round literally took them a day or even the same day! The recruiter was so resourceful and really cared. I would get calls to see how I am doing in prepping and basically for each round she would go over what i should focus on. As far as the interview goes, know your data structures(not just what they are, but how and when to use them for a given problem, I needed to use it twice in different interviews here). In addition, not sure if it is just for PE's but you basically need to know some sort of scripting(preferably both shell and some other like python,php or perl) I dont think some of the questions will be solved easily with out them. Lastly, for the systems rounds(you will have 2(1 phone and 1 onsite) KNOW your basic troubleshooting tools, linux command line, filesystem(for unix/linux based, like what goes where, knowing this will help for some sort of troubleshooting). Also try to solve questions like what to do when some is wrong type of questions. scoutapp's articles for tools was helpful for knowing some troubleshooting. Recruiter recommended a bunch for the coding, my favorite was leetcode. Careercup is good as well. Plus check more on glassdoor too, it especially helped for the first phone screen. Whatever the end outcome you will learn a lot from the experience. If anything you should be well off for other interviews after having to go through this process. Happy Interviewing:)

The most impressed I have ever been with the interview process! All employees with whom I interacted were friendly, positive, and had the process down to an art. The technical interviews I had seemed to be more focused on discovering what I could do rather than exposing my flaws, which I feel is something the majority of other tech giants are focused on. Both interviewers made a really strong effort to encourage staying calm and having fun solving the questions. I had a phone screen and two technical interviews. I've heard that some interns do get an additional onsite interview after this. The questions were focused on testing my linux skills and quickly solving small-scale problems, so you really need to know your linux and scripting foundations.

I signed an NDA, so I can't give my questions, but REALLY know your linux OS fundamentals (from high level concepts such as launching an executable to low level concepts like the different implementations of virtual memory).

Phone screen, then code-over the phone, followed by in person with 6-8 people in 4 interview sessions. The initial phonescreen covers typical techbusiness shibboleths, the coding interview was REALLY fun, and I was excited to do the inperson, but that when everything fell apart. For some reason, facebook has decided that at the inperson interview, you have to write your code on a whiteboard, and it can't have any bugs in it. They even tell you to practice coding on a whiteboard before the interview, because apparently, whiteboard coding is a big part of working at facebook. I'll just go ahead and say it, no one writes software longhand, it's not how it's done, and to expect people to write nontrivial things on a whiteboard in 2015 is beyond ridiculous, especially considering that part of facebook's own process is a code interview where you write a program using a computer! If you're interviewing a lumberjack, do you have him draw a chainsaw on a whiteboard? The most important thing to keep in mind if you want to get a job at facebook is that they reinvent everything. Every question they ask will be about how you would reinvent something. I was unprepared for the amount of guessing I was required to do (I'm terrible at guessing.) Remember when you're answering them that they have basically UNLIMITED RESOURCES and are willing to reinvent any wheel. I'm not saying what they're doing is bad, I'm saying it's completely different than anywhere else I've worked in many years in the business, and I think I'd be working there now if I had approached the questions with that in mind, instead of my instinct, which is to leverage the work of others as much as possible to my advantage, eg I look at what's out there on the internet, and then do whatever I need to. If there's something already there, I use that, if not, I'll write my own, or somewhere inbetween -- like everyone not working at facebook does. Don't blow it like I did, remember it's not a normal job, it's facebook, where there are always hackers hacking, and they have more money than Canada to hire more hackers to hack on whatever they've hacked together. The recruiters are nice, the management seemed friendly and capable, lunch wasn't very good but I was probably just stressed out. If you've ever been to the office when it was Sun Microsystems, be ready for a shock, also the cafeteria was like the mall at xmas. I'd love to work there, and on a different day I may have gotten the gig, but at the end of the day, you've still got to make it through a long gauntlet of bored looking engineers, looking to exclude you. They have unique problems there and it would be a super cool job, so I hope this helps someone else. As for me, I'll never go through it again.

Quick tech quiz with the recruiter over the phone. Then we scheduled two phone screens, one on coding, one on systems, both of them 1 hour long. Once you pass the phone screens you'll have to schedule an on-site visit which consists of 5 interviews, 45 minutes each: systems, networking, cultural, system architecture, coding. If you're not from CA, they'll fly you over to SFO, preferably on a Monday.

The quiz was pretty simple, you'll be asked basic questions about Linux. Battleship game: write a function that finds a ship and return its coordinates. Write a script that connects to 100 hosts, looks for a particular process and sends an email with a report. What is a filesystem, how does it work? File permissions, properties, file types. A write operation failed with an error, how do you figure out what happened? What's a signal and how is it handled by the kernel? What's a zombie process? Talk about an iostat output (what does user vs system cpu load mean, what does iowait% mean, cache vs buffers, why do we need caching, how much cache is needed, how can disk performance be improved, where is the bottleneck) How do TCP, UDP work? Describe what happens when a client opens a web page. How does DNS work? How does HTTP work? How does a router work?

I was contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. He asked several simple questions and then set up two phone screens, one for "systems" and one for "software engineering."

The interviewers varied in quality, but we generally pretty good.

Under NDA to not reveal interview questions however they are very predictable questions which could be easily understood based on the names of the interviews. There were no odd trick questions like "deploy SSH to 10,000 servers on the moon."   Answer Question

An recruiter contacted me by email and ask me to do a phone interview. She asked me whether I am familiar with production engineer's work and 10+ initial screen questions. They are all about basic Linux and networking knowledge, like port number and tcp protocol, Linux commands. Most of them are quite easy but they do really have some tricky questions. Afterward, I was told that I had passed and would have one coding interview and one system interview before making the final decision. The coding interview started about 1 weeks later. I was asked to code using stypi and there are two questions in 45 minutes. One is translate English to "Goat Latin" language with a set of predefined rules. It was not hard but I still spent 20-30 minutes on that, partly because I cared too much about the detail. The second question is more a shell-script coding, although I did not realize it immediately. I was asked to obfuscate local parts of email addresses found in all HTML files under a folder (also subfolders). Due to the time limit, I did not write a clean and complete code for it. But I discussed with the interviewers for the possible solutions (shell script + python regex operation). Then the recruiter told me I passes the first round and we moved on to system interview, which began 5 days later. Since it is totally new to me, I read lots of posts in glassdoor and other interviewing forums and there are very useful. The interview questions requires solid knowledge about Linux, operating system, performance monitoring. They both starts with a relatively simple questions but ends with lots of followup questions. Try your best to be open-minded and always talk with the interviewer. They want not only an correct answer, but also how you get this solution. Later that day I heard from the recruiter that the feedback seemed also great. After one week, they give me the offer. The salary is greater than I ever expected. Pros:    The recruiter is super nice and willing to answer any of your question in a timely manner.    The interviewing schedule is very flexible. You can propose any date as you like.    The interviewers are quite smart and patient. They are always on your side and trying to guide you through difficulties.

A recruiter reached out to discuss a position that may be a good fit with my skillset. It started with a phone interview followed up with a code review interview. The process took about 10 days. The interview questions were not difficult, some with several answers. Unix Process, networking, tcp/ip stack, and system administrative commands. The process was casual, I did notice before the interviews even started. Their coordination was awkward, after receiving numerous misspelled emails and wrong phone numbers. I was a little leery of working for them. Nonetheless, I continued with the 45-min code review interview and answered the question. Overall, the interviews were comparable to other companies. Also, they were efficient with their responses and answering questions.

The recruiter contacted me on Linkedin and during our initial exploratory conversation, I was asked several initial screening questions about my background. Afterward, I was scheduled for a 45-minute coding interview, about one week later. The interviewer contacted me at the proper time and we began the interview, using stypi.com. The first question came and went very quickly, though I did have some difficulty understanding the interviewer as English was not their first language. The second question also went by very quickly, though the interviewer kept hitting on what happens when a float is cast to/from a boolean in Python and ultimately, I suspect this is what put the interviewer against me. Overall, the questions asked were fair and weren’t unnecessarily complicated. The time from the phone screen to rejection was six days and the rejection message was the standard condescending boilerplate of, "We've found stronger candidates for this particular position," leaving me with no idea what I had done wrong and only my suspicions. Followup e-mails to figure out where I fell short were met with silence. The job posting had the following verbiage on it; "Our team is comprised of varying levels of experience and backgrounds, from new grads to industry veterans. Relevant industry experience is important, but ultimately less so than your demonstrated abilities and attitude. We sail into uncharted waters every day at Facebook in Production Engineering, and we are always learning." For a position that demands such a broad range of skills, I find it silly that what (I suspect, anyway) did me in was something that in a real-world situation, I could've just opened an interactive Python interpreter and entered a few of lines to prove / disprove the expected behavior. So much for "we are always learning." Pros: - Recruiter was friendly and was on top of things. - Decision was made quickly. - Interview questions were fair. Cons: - Interviewer dinged me for trivial things. - Coding interview did not reflect the broad knowledge required for the role. - Interview did not jive with the ethos of, "we are always learning." - I had some trouble understanding the interviewer and I suspect they also had trouble understanding me. - Standard condescending rejection boilerplate with followup e-mails routed to /dev/null.

First is for coding and the seconds is for linux system knowledge.

The interview lasted about 50 minutes. Sadly I was rejected based on feedback from the interviewer. The feedback stated the second question was fine, but the first question had an issue.

Was contacted by a recruiter. The recruiter initially asked me a handful of one-word-answer system administration questions. Subsequently had three phone screening interviews spaced over a couple of weeks before being invited to fly out to SF for an on-site interview. The screening interviews were straightforward 45-minute phone calls using an shared text editor site to code. The on-site interview was a full day consisting of 4 seperate interviews on different topics. The engineers I interacted with were all very friendly, and the questions asked were at times difficult but very fair: everything I was asked seemed very relevant to the potential job and assessing my general programming skill (no "stupid hard for the sake of being stupid hard" sort of questions). The campus is fantastic, and I got to spend a lot of time with the recruiter, who was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, asking questions and wondering around checking the place out. The trip would have been worth the time even if I didn't get an offer. About a week after my on-site interview, I got a call from the recruiter saying they wanted to offer me the position. The next day we discussed the compensation details, and a few days later I accepted.

A recruiter contacted me. After confirming that I would like to interview for the position, I was asked basic questions around networking, Linux system administration, and programming. A graduating Computer Science student should expect to pass this with little difficulty. Next was a phone interview for programming. I was asked to take input text and identify the unique words in the text and how many times each word occurred. Edge cases were important as was the performance. Interviewer asked for an analysis of the run-time and memory usage. Any second-year CS student should have no problem completing this in far less than the allocated time. Next was a phone interview for systems administration. I was given the bare minimum information possible about a system and told to describe how I discover running services and potential issues. As I progressed, the interviewer gave me information reasonable based on my descriptions and identified when I had correctly discovered a problem or possible problem. In investigating problems, it was important to be specific about why the problem was occurring and how to address the issue. When addressing problems, the performance, scalability, and maintainability of the solution was very important. Be prepared to identify how a file system is mounted or if it's local, and be prepared to encounter a single central share mounted by many servers with active read/write activity from them all. This will be difficult for anyone without good real-world Linux systems administration experience. Next I was flown out to HQ for a series of on-site interviews. A manager spoke to me to gauge my understanding of Facebook and the Production Engineering position (rely on the job description and don't be afraid to ask your recruiter lots of questions!) and to get to know me. There's another interview about coding and another one for systems administration. Both are along the same lines as the phone interview, but more in-depth and more difficult. There's a systems design interview, where you'll be given a target and asked to design a scalable and performant system to accomplish the goal. You may be asked to analyze the storage requirements (core and/or persistent) and network requirements of your system. The last interview type is a networking interview, which is very in-depth and requires extensive knowledge of TCP/IP, UDP/IP, DNS, etc. Essentially, start at a command prompt and think of what happens when you type "telnet www.facebook.com 80" - be prepared to talk about almost every single network-related thing that happens at all seven OSI layers. Know your packet layouts! Throughout the entire process, my recruiter was always on top of keeping me informed and always answered questions very quickly (I rarely waited even most of a day for a reply). I rarely needed to ask anything about what to expect because she kept me so well informed. Don't worry too much about thinking at Facebook's scale, they understand that very few people have worked on anything even approaching their size and scale.

Was initially contacted via LinkedIn by an internal Facebook recruiter that dealt specifically with this role. I was impressed with the recruiter's technical knowledge, always a good sign, and agreed to go through the screening and start the interview process. The process is 5 steps: * Call with recruiter about position * Phone screening with a few trivia questions regarding systems administration. * Co-operative coding phone interview * Systems phone interview * On-Site interview The call with the recruiter was mostly about the position description and duties, and assessing whether both sides think it's a good fit. The phone screening, also done with the recruiter, is just a few questions that anyone who has administered Linux for an organization would be able to answer off the top of their head. The coding interview was done using a collaborative editing tool, so both parties could see what was being typed. The coding questions were not your typical abstract data manipulation questions, but rather questions that required systems knowledge, and in my case were most easily answered with shell scripts. I didn't actually do the systems phone interview, as they considered my programming interview strong enough to simply skip this step. I'm informed this is not uncommon. The on-site interview loop included five 45-minute segments: Programming, Systems, Networking, Solution Architecture, and meeting with the Manager (not in that order). Additionally, lunch with the initial recruiter and a brief chat afterwards with a different recruiter that dealt with the financial and logistics portions of the interview and negotiations. One thing that struck me during the entire process is that *everyone* I spoke to, and I mean *everyone* because I asked them all, absolutely loved working there. Every time I asked someone how they liked working at Facebook, their face lit up and they started listing off reasons they loved working there, and everyone had the same reason: They liked everyone around them, felt trusted and respected, and trusted and respected the people around them. This was unanimously the first reason, usually followed by "and the work is really interesting".

I applied online for a production engineering position. A recruiter did a screening interview with me to assess where my strengths lay, and to determine which role would be the best fit. They recommended a production engineering role. We scheduled a phone interview which covered several programming/scripting questions. After getting positive feedback, we scheduled another phone interview which covered linux system administration and troubleshooting. Although I received positive feedback from that interview as well, the existing production engineering roles were filled. My recruiter asked if I would be interested in pursuing another role within the organization, specifically a software engineering role. We scheduled an interview with that team. I had a bad day, and couldn't focus during the interview, totally blowing it. I didn't receive an offer, although if given another chance I believe I would be offered one.

HR contacted me from Linkedin. There was 3 phone interviews for screening, code test and system administration test. First interview, recruiter went through some questions, such as port number, routing, Linux commands, and some basic language wise questions. Second interview was a coding test. Engineer had me to write two script for csv data processing, and system monitoring. Third one was for system administration. The questions were pretty open. The interviewer had me to dig into the internals of operating system, such as performance tuning, memory model, paging, swap, process forking, system call, interrupt, and etc. I passed 3 interviews, and flew to Facebook campus for a whole day onsite interview (with NDA signed). During the interview process, I felt people there are super nice, and gave me chances to answer questions correctly.

It starts with the screening call. Here I was asked a little about what I currently do, and then some general questions: ports, subnet math, linux commands, TCP. I got most of the right, so I was qualified to begin the proper interviews. I found out there were going to be two 45 minute phone interviews and if I passed both, I will be brought on site in their Menlo Park location for some more interviews. The first is a programming interview, in the language of your choice, using collabedit. You'll be asked to write a function and a small program that do different things. They will not actually run the code, but rather speak with you about what you've written down. The tasks were pretty basic, so I assume they also follow your general attitude towards the problems and how you structure everything and present what you are doing. The interviewer is not allowed to give direct feedback but you'll probably know if he's got a good feeling or not. After about a week I got an email telling me that I've passed and I scheduled my second phone interview.  The second phone interview is a linux systems administration interview, also using (when needed) collabedit. This is a pretty thorough interview and the questions go as deep as the linux kernel. You'll have to know how things like how the bash interpreter works, process forking and killing, memory management, process tracing and debugging. My systems administration knowledge is not that deep so this interview did not go as well.

Three 45-minute phone interviews. A positive review from each qualified me for the next. First interview was a basic-technical one with their recruiter: port numbers, subnet math, Linux commands. Second was a Collabedit programming interview. An engineer had me build a performance monitoring script, adding more features and improving efficiency as we went. Third was a systems interview. Heavy operating systems theory was involved. This engineer's confessed style was improvisational, probing areas of knowledge my previous answers had laid claim to. It helped to know enough systems stuff, and to be interested enough in it, to make the conversation span the whole interview time. I passed the third phone interview, so Facebook flew me to their campus for a day of on-site interviews. I had to sign an NDA covering my experiences on that day. What I can say is that I thought it went at least as well as my phone interviews, yet I got a rejection email a week later.

Everyone I spoke with was reasonably personable and competent. The process went quite smoothly and was relatively painless. 5 phone contacts: * basic screening (might you be a good fit for the position) * basic programming * (single) system administration * basic description of what will come next+handoff to another recruiter * in-depth description with new recruiter of what to expect during the on-site interviews 5 onsite interviews+lunch: You first meet your recruiter, with a brief overview of the day. * Production Engineer Manager   - Getting to know you, talk about what a Production Engineer does. * Coding   - Algorithmically simple (write ____ system utility), but you need to be able to intelligently discuss complexity and tradeoffs of optimizations (CPU/RAM). What is the theoretical best performance?   - You don't need to know exact details of APIs, but you need to know what calls are available, and have a deep understanding of how things work. You should know exactly what is happening, including the complexity of any system calls you make.   - Accuracy and and efficiency in your code are crucial. * Systems   - FB has problems on a scale you have not yet realized. They hit problems you haven't ever seen.   - When you see ____ crazy problem, what do you do? How do you figure out what the fundamental problem is? Once you know the problem, how can you mitigate it?   - Explain in detail what happens when you run ____ command.   - Think about this sort of information: what problems are you going to run into while doing IPC (pipes, shared memory structures etc.)? How exactly does the OS transfer information across a pipe? What are the limits or bottlenecks? * LUNCH   - Good food, relax and get to know your recruiter a little better. Get a better feel for the environment. Ask questions off the record, so to speak. * Design/Architecture   - FB understands you probably don't have experience at their scale. Just do your best to extend what you know to their scale.   - How do you do ____ across a large number of systems? How do you do it without interrupting production? How long will it take?   - When doing estimation, be sure to explain your thought processes. * Networking   - Probably the least important of the 4 technical interviews.   - Be familiar with packet routing (How does the source computer know where to route packets? How do packets move across a network?).   - Know how to configure and use at least one client/server network service (and talk about it intelligently). How does it work internally? What are the features of XXX protocol? Last, you talk to your recruiter about what you think about the recruiting process, the position, how well it fits you, considerations that you may need to think about before making a final decision.

The individual questions are not difficult. I'd expect any network engineer worth his salt to have no difficulty with the networking questions. Likewise, the coding shouldn't be a problem for a software developer, and systems isn't going to be hard for a systems administrator. The trouble is the /breadth/ of questions. What are the limits of your knowledge? Can you make a reasonable guess as to what is going on based on what you do know?   Answer Question

The process was pretty spread-out but extremely well coordinated and communicated. Expectations were perfectly managed. Since I was remote, they had me go through a set of 3 phone screenings, each very technical. Passing each phone screen lead to the next, with passing the final round leading to an in-person interview and trip to Menlo Park, CA. The pictures of the campus there don't do it justice. It's a really surprising environment. I really can't say enough how awesome their recruiting staff is. They always replied promptly and helpfully, and were awesome to work around my schedule every step along the way. In the final analysis I just wasn't a good fit for the position - and I even agree with them. After seeing and hearing so much of the cool stuff they do behind the scenes and are working on doing, I am not (yet) qualified for that job. In the end, the thing I felt most qualified in was my big stumble. What I learned was to be on their level, it wasn't enough to have just done what I've done for a long time - that they justifiably want an expert in multiple disciplines. Their benefits are just absurdly great. Everything they offer is top-notch including their facility in Menlo Park, where the old Sun research campus used to be. In the end, it was a great experience. I got to go and interview with one of the biggest Internet companies in the world and meet some brilliant people and see just how great their environment is. I realized that in the right environment, I can go head to head with some of the best - and got a quick trip out there to boot!

I was solicited by FB recruiter through LinkedIn. I followed up given my perception of FB being fast pace and open culture. After PS, I went on-site which contains the standard 5 rounds: behavioral & culture fit; coding; coding; design; design. I was never a fan of behavioral questions and never felt such questions are inspirational, FB is no difference. There was a quick 10-minute coding problem near the end of this round --- you have no time to think but just to code it up. The first coding problem is simple but a little tedious to write code. The second coding problem is medium difficulty with two parts. The first part is simple and I quickly code it. I had to think about the second part to identify the algorithm but had no time to implement it. In both design rounds, despite the interviewer’s claim that the problem is opened-ended without perfect answer, and what’s important is the thought process, he didn’t really mean it --- a solution that perfectly matches what the interviewer had in mind is expected. The interviewer, graduated from school a few years back, does not have rich project experiences to handle deviations from his standard solution. The interviewer simply likes to move fast on the track of his solution. Any deviation from that track becomes a distraction instead of part of true problem solving process. Overall I am disappointed with FB interview process. The FB interview loop obviously not really evaluate and identify true problem solving skills or experiences but just how fast you can write bug-free code for simple algorithm problem with little or no time to think. It effectively requires that you have coded the same or very similar problem very recently. I am confident on my coding and problem solving skills and like to present the daily true me instead of an interview-prepared me. FB hires lots of young graduates and expect them to write fast code. Maybe coding fast and breaking things is fine for web pages, but I suspect how terrible their back-end infrastructure would be due to the code fast mentality.

Recruiter contacted me on LinkedIn. We set up initial telephonic chat. Followed by two telephonic interviews. Both were coding and Algorithms related. I didn't do well with first one, I got feedback saying I was slow in providing response. Because of my background they kindly gave me another chance, which I did Ok. Then followed by on site. I wanted to do well in on site so I took a while to prepare and scheduled interview date almost 3 weeks after . I practiced 100+ questions on LeetCode. I also studied large scale system design questions. It's like practice daily 2 hours just for this interview. This is really helped to come up with solutions during on site interview. The on site consists of 2 coding & algorithm questions, 2 design questions and 1 behavior + coding. Except first coding question, because of interviewer poor communication skills, I did n't completely understand what's the problem, in all other rounds I gave my best. After waiting for almost 2 weeks I got a feedback saying they are passing my application. I guess my best is not enough for them. Sometimes even though you prepare well, some factors make you unfit for job, that's a fate. Any case overall I've great experience and get a chance to visit FB campus.

The process as such is standard. Three interviewers were good. The other two I felt had some solution in mind, and wanted me to approach the exact same way. Its almost as if they expect one to mug up a solution and produce the output. There is absolute no room for creative thinking. The interviewer does not work with the interviewee to produce a better solution, instead expects to bark text book answers. Interview should not be a place where in, the skills are judged based on the number of lines of code and code beautification, but instead one should try to evaluate the skills based on thinking and approach taken.

It was made of four talks with technical guys, all very positive and friendly. I failed to be as good as I was expected to be, so I haven't been given an offer. The tasks I had to solve seemed easy on first sight, but actually allowed different ways of solving them. Also I failed to convince interviewers in the impact I have done in design of my previous projects.

A rather long process, expect at least a week between interview portions. 'Phone interview' was done in person - was ninja interview - took 4 days for feedback and next steps took at least a week to plan Real interview consisted of 5 interviews plus a lunch that wasn't an interview. One week later I was told to immediately provide contacts from my current employer. 4 days later I was rejected.

I am a woman engineer with experience applying for a Senior Sw Engineer position. Recruiter contacted me initially. She was allowed me to postpone screen as needed, as I wanted to prepare a little more on the algorithmic side, and I did. I went in person rather than phone. The interviewer was nice and the problem was moderate to difficult (involving trees) for a phone screen. This was my first time resolving it. Although it took me some time, I did give a solution that the interviewer was satisfied with, we had time for questions, for finding out what he was working on at the moment. I got out feeling good and confident. I received a disappointing automatic message with rejection. I asked for feedback but did not receive it. I felt confused and upset that Facebook didn't give me a chance for on site. There aren't many women engineers in high tech, and walking on the floor at Facebook there is evidence there aren't there either. Given Sheryl Sandberg's vocal support of women and my satisfactory screen, I would have hoped that the company tries to do much more in their own backyward, to change the status quo regarding gender imbalance in predominantly male roles at Facebook.

Screening interview only: a technical coding challenge, medium to difficult involving trees. The question can be found in online training material or books but I didn't resolve it before.   Answer Question

I was contacted by the recruiter through LinkedIn. After an initial call from HR, I had an technical Skype interview. It took 45 minutes. 30 min. of coding plus 15 min. for experience related stuff and my questions. I wasn't satisfied with my performance, but surpassingly I passed. We were about to schedule a day long on-side interview process. In the meantime, however, I got another offer and I resign, as this and preparation would have taken too much time.

Except experience related questions I was asked coding question and I was supposed to write the solution to the problem in any programming language in a simple web-based code editor. The question was: given and array of positive integers and another integer find whether there is a consecutive range in the array, so that the sum of integers in the range is equal to the given number. They put an emphasis on delivering working, efficient solution. In my opinion this kind of interview requires a thorough preparation.   4 Answers

Recruiter called me and asked a couple of HR questions. Schedule a phone interviewed. First phone interview is not hard at all; I implemented with Java but obviously it's not what interviewer thought. Then along with second phone interview. two questions, I did them quick. 2 days later I was asked to join the on-site interview. I am a little bit nervous in my on-site. Basically the questions were not hard at all. But I was too nervous(It was my first on-site interview in US) and wasn't able to figure out the best solution before timeout.

I entered the process via a recruiter I'd worked with previously. I started out with a phone screen that went well -- some simple puzzle questions that were easy to work out on the fly. From there I moved on to the on-site interview. This was a series of 4-5 one-on-one interviews with engineers who posed various technical problems -- whiteboard coding, design problems. I found the questions moderately challenging, but none were killers. I'm pretty sure there was a "culture fit" session in there somewhere, too. I didn't like what I sensed of the interviewers' attitudes -- most of them seemed more interested in showing how smart he was than in hearing from me. It hinted at a lack of confidence, and a work atmosphere with some unhealthy internal politics and competition.

I recall that the questions were moderately challenging, but not killers by any means.   Answer Question

Was submitted as an employee referral, so this may have been quicker than some other folks' experience; first talk with a recruiter to offer was about 10 days. The recruiting team was very on the ball, also. Had one talk with a recruiter about my background, a technical phone screen (as with many companies, writing actual code over a shared-document web page), and a half day on site of in-person interviews. Interviews on site were 3 technical sessions (two coding, one design), a deep discussion of my experience and work style with a manager, and a social lunch (which one should assume is also a "fit" interview although no company I've visited called it that.) Interviewers were down to earth rather than with the attitude I'd expect of some of the large "hot" companies; the two coding problems involved fairly standard (if potentially fiddly) string or graph manipulations -- one required recursion (or a fairly complicated stack structure) while the other was easier iteratively, and I was asked to re-implement it using recursion in remaining time. As with pretty well everywhere, expect to also give a big-O estimate of the run time, and find some failure cases (or at least explain where you're already handling it.) The design interview question was tailored to some specialized work I've done and the particular is probably not representative of most groups; as I understand it, everyone gets some level of design interview and it's usually roughly some form of "how would you build this part of an app like ours for our scale." Got my offer a few days after interviewing. Overall, a very positive experience.

The most unexpected question was the design problem; the most difficult was one of the technical questions which was to implement a subset of regular expression.   Answer Question

Recruiter contacted me. First telephonic interview was 45 mins and a single coding question. All interviewers were good except one of the interviewer who asked about system design question (he was rude and wanted to show off). 1) Behavior - prepare for difficult bug etc. questions. What u want to do at Facebook. 2) Lunch 3) System design - give more importance to these type of questions. Asked me about design a system to run a command on all the servers (say 1 million) within the same network from one of the server on the network. 4) Coding - Given a NxN matrix with values X and O where X represent land and O represent water find the number of islands. Two consecutive X X (horizontal or vertical) will be part of single island while diagonal X X are not. (Solve using graph - DFS or BFS) 5) Coding - from list of strings, generate list of list of strings which are anagrams of each other. I did really well, but I guess not good compared to other candidates. Overall interview was easy if you have prepared for Algos and Data Structures.

Telephonic interview and then hiring event on Hyd.

It was one of the easiest interview that i had and completely unexpected from company like facebook. Limited set of questions and one question per round. Total 2 coding questions and one design question and lastly cultural fit round. Its completely unfair to have less number of questions and that too relatively easy ones. It doesnt give much scope of creativity and thinking and a small mistake can prove to be too costly.

I received a phone call a few days after applying for a position online. After a brief screening of my skills, the recruiter set up a phase-1 interview with a single Engineer. She gave me the option of doing it over the phone or at the Facebook headquarters. I chose the latter because I live nearby. I was scheduled for a 45 minute interview. The engineer was very friendly and inquisitive about my past projects. This is the easy part, talking about myself. He didn't have a copy of my resume, which I thought was lame. Anyway, after discussing my more recent projects, we moved on to the whiteboard coding part of the interview. This part was a pleasant surprise. It was done in a collaborative way, where I would discuss my solution, psudo-code, then code, and receive suggestions or other form of input from the engineer. The last 15 minutes were spent discussing the culture at Facebook and specifics about the team I was interviewing for. It took them more than a week to get back to me, which I would like to think was because they wanted to complete interviews for the other candidates.

Three phone screens, 1st with Recruiter, second with an engineer, third with an engineer. The engineers were great to talk to, very cooperative and collaborative. The questions they asked were typical text book puzzle programming tricks. The first engineer was not interested in exploring finding a correct answer to the problem, but instead had a particular best-performance trick in mind and wasn't really satisfied that the trick could not be discovered easily. The second engineer was far more collaborative and also seemed to be driving towards a best-performance answer, but he entertained possible solution ideas and was very collaborative in guiding towards the solution he was looking for. The first engineer was very animated and excited about his roles and positions at facebook, while the second was a bit more reserved but opened up when asked what he liked about the company and what he thought could be better. Both engineers were working on exciting highly scalable challenging products that would likely be a dream job for many software engineers, including myself. I loved the collaborative editing suite facebook uses to do the coding questions online and found it very helpful in sharing notes and coding solutions. Similar suites for other companies have low character limits and/or wonky execution. I received a prompt response after the second interview that Facebook will not be proceeding further, though I thought both interviews went well (aside from not knowing the the programming trick the interviewer had in mind). The recruiter or hiring manager also flagged my profile in facebook somehow so I receive a not-so-warm greeting at the top of every other job page I view on facebook saying "Facebook will not consider you further" more or less, which is a bit rude in my opinion. If an engineer does not fit for one group in the company that does not mean they will not fit at all. Like others, I received no feedback from the recruiter on why I was passed over, which is unfortunate because the more I learned about the company through interviewing, the more interested I became in giving Facebook a shot as a part of my career.

This was probably one of the longest interview processes I had to go through. The recruiter was wonderful. She was always very professional and responsive. First I had a phone interview with the hiring manager. It was a very straight forward conversation and he asked me to give him some pseudo code on how to square a number using their online tool. Standard algorithm questions which I answered correctly. Afterward, the recruiter said it went well and that she would be in contact with me about what the next steps are. A week goes by and she calls me back telling me I have to write an Adobe Air or Java application using the Facebook API's. I thought it was a little bit much for them to ask me to spend my time writing something I would not be getting paid for. I really wanted to get the job and impress the hiring manager though so I spent my free time, over a two week period making something that looked great and worked really well. It then took them two months to review the application. To me this was totally unprofessional and kind of a slap in the face. The recruiter was in contact with me the whole time and told me they were all busy with their big change to the privacy features. Finally the hiring manager looked at the application but the recruiter told me they wanted someone else internal to look at the code as well. She told me they were impressed with the application and had rejected a lot of other candidates applications right away. I sat in limbo another few weeks while another person looked at the application. The recruiter then calls me back to tell me that the position I was applying for was dropped. Not that they hired someone else, but that they changed the role I was applying for completely. I think the software engineering interview process has hit an all time low. First they make the engineer jump through hoops of logic games. Then spout out algorithms and uses of design patterns like robots. Finally you have to spend your free time writing something that they are only going to throw in the garbage. We have all really fallen to a sad state.

I had a phone interview with a Facebook recruiter. That lead to a phone screen with an engineer and code tests using a shared text editor. I was then invited on-site for an all day marathon of four 45 minute whiteboard interviews. The on-site was odd. Of the 4, 2 interviews were decent and work related: high level discussions of design. The other 2 were standard Valley algorithm tests. I really don't see the point of these things. They have no relation to actual work and are completely arbitrary.

I applied online and within a few days received a request to choose a date for a 45min technical interview. They sent me a link of the "collabedit" I think - to familiarize myself with it. Once I got on the phone with the interviewer, she send me the link and she had already typed the problem that I had to solve. The problem statement was unclear, when I asked questions she could not explain well what she wanted, there was a lot of disturbance on the phone - so I offered to start writing some code but she would not let me write till I came up with some idea of how I would proceed with the data structure she had in mind. Unfortunately, we spent 40 minutes just talking and brainstorming and then finally in the last 5 minutes she said I could start coding. I quickly wrote some working code, but ofcourse 5 minutes is just not enough. Overall, I think they should have a timed online code assessment where these all issues don't come in the way.

Applied online, was contacted by a recruiter. Had one phone screen then was asked to come in for a full loop at the Seattle campus. The culture is unusual for a tech company. It is both good and not so great. The interview was amateur grade. All of the people who interviewed me, except one, had significantly less experience than I did. It's not an ego issue. In most cases, they had a little more than 1 year of experience. The problem with someone like that interviewing you is that they might not know of a good way to do it. For example, I was constantly interrupted. I let them know that I was thinking out loud and that everything I say might not be the best way to do something. When I have something concrete I'll set it forward and we can discuss that. That didn't stop the interruptions. I'd lose my train of thought and would have to start again. Again, while writing code, the same thing. I said that the code isn't optimized, i'll optimize it later. I'm trying to get it right, then tweak it later. Every few lines, I was asked if something was necessary. I was pretty frustrated by the end. I wish I could tell them that you're interviewing me- meaning you want to see how I think, check my problem solving ability and NOT show how much you know. You're probably good at what you do, else you wouldn't have been there. Can we please focus on me solving the problem? In other interviews, at other companies, I've noticed the more experience a person has the more patient and observant they are during an interview. They will ask questions and prod, but almost never interrupt unless you're heading down a seriously questionable line of thinking path.

A recruiter has contacted me through linked-in, asked whether I'll be interested to work for them, then had a talk about why would I like to work for them and I replied: that I would like to work with the best engineers. Afterward I had a phone interview with some engineer, asked me to write binary search, when I finished, he asked me to write binary search on a shifted array (10 20 1 2 3 4). Wrote that and then asked me to find the offset (2) in log n. I guess I did that ok and then I was invited to onsite interview. I had 4 consecutive interviews: first one was a general talk about my experience, second was to write a json beautifer, third was to design their newsfeed, and last was to write a program that prints all subsets of size k of a given set with n integers.

It was all easy.   1 Answer

It was the first round interview on phone for a full-time position. Half of the interview was behavioral and half was a coding exercise where you had to write a running program. The whole interview process was decent and there were multiple recruiting people involved in contacting me so was a bit messy.

The program was somewhat related to finding different combinations of all the digits of an integer number with some conditions like sum &lt; k and they can be grouped together to form a combination. It was hard and time-consuming to solve. It was a difficult one and   Answer Question

Chatted with an recruiter, who then directed me to the recruiter for Facebook Seattle. She had a list of multiple choice android questions as a really quick initial screen. After that had a skype interview with an engineer there. Mostly coding questions worked through in an online shared textpad environment. After that had a day with 4 onsite interviews. One was around system design, one was on career so far/career goals, and two more coding interviews.

Very friendly and open. Strong emphasis on problem solving and interpersonal skills and little emphasis on technical minutiae. (The initial interview was pure code but no gotcha questions.) The on site interview was four one hour sessions with either one or two people (the second being a shadow interviewer in training) with fifteen minutes of algorithm stuff and forty five of problem solving. (One was just problem solving). The only negative with all this is that it was very compressed (no breaks between sessions except for lunch which was with another employee) I was recalibrated afterwards and had to do an extra interview by phone. (I scored high on a newly added question so I was reinterviewed on the question it replaced.) The result was that my offer improved. Throughout the process everyone involved was friendly, open, and within limits helpful.

I won't answer this because it's covered by NDA and it wouldn't do you any good. I will say that most of the questions are thought provoking and have no one right answer. Facebook's recruiters will give you lots of excellent advice for preparation — their goal is to find good people, not trip people up on dumb stuff.   1 Answer

Recruiter contacted me. It was followed by a phone screen where I was asked to solve a problem on coderpad. I was brought onsite to the Menlo Park office where I had to go through 4 rounds of interview - one career discussion+coding, two completely coding and one system design. The office seemed pretty dead and so did the people. During the design round, the interviewer never gave me any feedback and was busy typing on his phone the entire time. The lunch interviewer found it hard to smile it seemed. Overall, the place gave a pretty negative vibe to me.

I took him 7 days to collect feedbacks. I have few competing offers deadline approaching, which really annoyed me. I sent one email to my hr per day, and then she just stopped replying to me for few days. Anyway, the interview process was extremely slow in my case.

Facebook has to be the worst company to interview for in the Bay Area when it comes to engineering. Facebook likes to hire engineers almost exclusively from two demographics (White & Asian) and that's it. If you don't belong, then do yourself a favor and do not waste time interviewing with them : Facebook won't hire you. Not only that, engineers conducting the interview will put you under more scrutiny than they would other candidates. You will be at a disadvantage from the first question. Simply, they are not used to hiring engineers from your background and they will set you up to fail the interview, a self fulfilling prophecy. My advice to Facebook is, in general, train well your engineers in regards to unconscious bias and have them certify before allowing them to conduct interviews. In particular, I would add to no let engineers on sponsored visas that have been in the country for only a short time conduct interviews to citizens and permanent (green card) residents as they do not understand yet the race dynamics of the U.S.A. It just does not feel right. It would be fine to let them conduct interviews for other candidates looking for visa sponsorship though.

I was initially contacted by a recruiter and we had an initial discussion about engineering at Facebook and my interests. I was then scheduled for a phone interview. The phone interview was with an Engineer and he asked 2 pretty standard coding questions, nothing crazy. After the phone interview, I was invited onsite. The onsite interview consisted of 5 sessions: * A discussion with the interviewer about my past experience and how I reacted to certain situations ("tell me about a time when" type questions) and a coding question * 3 coding sessions * A system design session I also had lunch with an Engineer and was able to ask additional questions during lunch. Overall, the sessions were well managed. 2 of the coding sessions involved standard coding questions that can be found on various online resources (leetcode, geeks for geeks, etc). The third was a question that I hadn't seen before and that I found challenging. I ran out of time on this particular session. The system design question was relatively straightforward. The discussion + coding session threw me for a loop. I had a discussion with the interviewer for most of the session about various situations in the past. Suddenly, he said "ok, we have less than ten minutes left, time to code". It was a little jarring and I had a little bit of a tough time switching gears so suddenly. The question itself wasn't too difficult, but the sudden change caught me off guard and I had some mistakes in my solution. Overall the interviewers were very nice and respectful. When I had the opportunity to ask questions, it felt like they were hones and sincere in their answers (it didn't feel like unnecessary corporate cheerleading). After my onsite had concluded, I received an email for feedback on the interview, which was nice. They asked for detailed feedback on the interview and whether or not the folks were on time for the sessions. It seems like Facebook takes their interview process and the feedback seriously (from what I can gather). In the end, I was not extended an offer, but the overall process was very efficient and smooth.

I attended Facebook's University Day, where they had about 20 university students who were there for interviews. The day starts off with the interview itself, then you spend about 5 hours touring the Facebook campus and learning more about Facebook. When the interview process began, all of us were siting in a room and interviewers would come in and call our names. I watched as interviewer after interviewer came in with cheerful looks on their faces and called out names of other students. After about 5 minutes, my interviewer came in and called me. He was a heavy set man, dressed sloppy, and had a look on his face like he didn't want to be there. I could tell right away that it would not go well. When we entered the interview room, he immediately began asking technical questions. He didn't ask any questions about me to get to know me, and after asking other students that were there, they all began with a talk about their backgrounds. During the entire interview, I had the impression that my interviewer just wanted to rush me through so he could go on to do something else. He asked me 2 questions, one which went well and a second where I had a bit of trouble. My recruiter had told me beforehand that if we got stuck on a question, our interviewer would make an effort to get us back on track by offering hints. My interviewer did no such thing. I even told him what I was trying to do, and why I was getting stuck, implying that I could use a hint. He just sat there without saying anything. Finally after I wasted about 10 minutes trying different ways to solve it, he tells me that we're running out of time and hurries me through the rest of the problem. He gave me the last 5 minutes to ask him questions. Since I had a feeling that he was being forced to be there, one of my questions was if Facebook employees have dedicated interviewers, or if random employees are selected to be interviewers from time to time. He said it was the latter. So of course I knew that he was being forced to be there and he just wanted it to end. After the interview was over, he walked me back to meet the other students. By this time I already knew he wasn't going to give me a good review, but Facebook doesn't all you to go home at this point. You're forced to spend 5 hours learning about how wonderful it is to work at Facebook so that you know about all the good things you just missed out on. A week later I received my rejection email.

Had a phone interview followed by on site. Phone interview was good and the interviewer was very friendly. During onsite, I had about 5 one one one interviews. My interviews started on a bad note - the recruiter was late to pick me up from the lobby and my first interviewer came 10 minutes late. He then rushed me into a system design question. I outlined the initial design and checked with him if there were any specific directions he wanted to go into but got no response. I then kept working on the design question without him giving me any feedback. When there were only 5 minutes left, he started asking some questions on how some scenarios would work. I always thought that interviews were supposed to be a discussion rather than the candidate talking and other people listening but perhaps its different at Facebook. Other interviews were also average - my third interviewer was a girl who seemed too full of herself and kept being very sarcastic. My fourth interviewer hardly showed any interest in my thesis work though he was a very experienced guy so its possible, they are able to absorb everything without even listening.

The question itself was moderately difficult, and would be really hard to solve without a bit of help, in my opinion, and the interviewer didn't seem to care much.

Phone interview. The HR arranged an phone interview after my application was referred by an current employee. The interviewer called on time. He introduced himself very quickly and also talked about what he is doing now for the job. After that he let me to talk about the most challenge project I have ever made. Then the coding question begins: he tried to mislead me by using a very long description about the question. For example, this is about PHP bla bla... But actually the question is about Depth First Search. There was just one question because I was slow. I think I will be rejected.

The process was very nice. I met with an engineer at my school's career fair and handed them my resume. After two days, I got an email from a recruiter telling me that they wanted to set me up with an interview on my campus. They also invited me to a dinner with the other students that they got in touch with, which was nice. The interview at my school was a 45-minute interview where they asked me one technical question. It went well and the interviewer was very nice. After that interview, I heard back within two days that they wanted to move forward. I was then able to schedule an interview on-site at their office in Menlo Park. When it was time, they flew me out to Menlo Park for Facebook University Day. I had one 45-minute interview in the morning, followed by a full day of getting to see what Facebook had to offer, including a tour of the office. The on-site interview was the final stage of the process for interns. They sent me their final decision within a week.

I am an experienced engineer. My phone interview was pretty standard. I got through 2 coding questions, and had a great chat with the interviewer. I was called onsite shortly. Onsite I had 5 modules. 3 "ninja modules", which are coding based, 1 "jedi module" which is behavioral/resume/experience and a small coding problem, and 1 "pirate module", which is system design. I've done interviews with Google and LinkedIn as well (and got offers from both), and the coding problems at Facebook were actually the simplest. I smashed all the coding interviews. The Jedi interview was pretty good too. The place where I failed was the pirate module. If you are interviewing with FB, I cannot stress enough that you really really need to prep system design. I actually failed my design interview spectacularly (they asked me to design a popular feature on FB). But based on my other performances, they decided to call me back the next week for another system design interview. Well, I failed that one too, LOL. Yes, apparently I was that bad at system design. It is strange, because at Google I was specifically told that the system design interview was used to "slot" a software engineer only (senior, staff, etc.). i.e. it was not a dealbreaker. For FB, apparently it is a dealbreaker. Personally I think every one has certain strengths and weaknesses. I readily admit that my weakness is system design. My strength is algorithms and coding, and I've actually done pretty well in competitive programming as well. But FB really would prefer to see someone who knows a decent amount about everything, rather than be really good at one thing (algorithms and coding) and not great at another (system design). As far as the interviewers go, they were an amazing bunch. Even when I was bombing the system design module, the interviewer was very respectful, encouraging, and friendly. I walked away with a very positive experience. Everyone was excited to be working there, and I can see that it is a terrific place! If you are interviewing there, my advice is to really read up on many many open source architectures, and thoroughly understand system design. If you clear that module, you will almost certainly get in, the other stuff isn't hard at all.

The interviewer briefly introduced himself in terms of when he has joined the company and what project he has (lately) worked on. Then I was required to solve a coding task. I'd say the task was rather simple, and what the interviewer was looking for was: -- ability to quickly grasp the task at hand -- ability to quickly come up with idea how to (efficiently enough) solve it -- ability to quickly and correctly turn your idea into working code. Suggestion: once you're done coding -- go through your code, check how it will handle the corner cases, reason out loud about what you're doing. Don't panic :) Than, at the end you are given the opportunity to ask questions. As you can expect, they'd like to see you show genuine interest in how things are done there, so showing some excitement helps a lot.

Questions I've been asked: Do you think what you just coded is correct? Show me (reason) how your code will behave on <this-particular-input> What is the time/space complexity of what your solution? Can we do better than that? Are you sure we can't?   1 Answer

I was local to the Facebook offer so they did the screens in person. The first one did not go very well, but went well enough to get a second chance (as opposed to a full interview). The second one went better and I was invited back for a full day of interviews. They were able to rush the process since I had other offers. The full day interview was 4 interviews. 1 system design question, 1 manager interview ("Tell me about a time..."), 2 algorithms questions. Everyone was welcoming and enthusiastic, so that made the stressful process easier. I got a call from the recruiter about 4 days later telling me they were not moving forward with an offer. A bit disappointing and it wasn't entirely clear why as I thought the interview went well. I was interviewing for a smaller office so maybe that made a difference.

I applied to Facebook through their website and got a call from the recruiter the next day. He asked the standard screening questions and set up a technical phone screen for later that week. The phone screen was done using coderpad.io, and they threw me off from the very beginning by setting up a C++ environment although I had told the recruiter that I was most comfortable in Python and although I never claimed anywhere that I had any familiarity with C++. Still, interview questions tend to be general enough that, as long as you aren't completely unfamiliar with the language syntax, you can generally do a decent job in any language. So off we went in C++. The interviewer was very pleasant, and even gave me some tips for how to improve my resume at the beginning. Then we dived into the coding. He had actually chosen a great question to determine my programming ability. Unfortunately, I botched it by making too many assumptions about the question and not considering carefully enough what lay behind the interface that the interviewer had provided me. This all happened maybe two or three weeks ago and I am sure that I won't be progressing to the next step. The one negative in all this is that the recruiter has not followed up at all with me. Yes, rejection is not uncommon when applying at a company like Facebook, but that doesn't mean that the company shouldn't have the courtesy to at least inform you of it. So overall, great experience in the beginning but I was turned off by the lack of respect for the process that I sensed from the recruiter.

Interview was for software engineer. I got the interview call through career fair at campus. It was a telephonic interview for 45 min. The interviewer was very polite and helpful. In the end I messed up things. It started off with the interviewer introducing himself, and asked to introduce my self. Then some behavioral questions, like why Facebook, which team, either Front-end or Back-end are you interested in, and a couple of questions on my projects and resume. The interviewed happened on a Thursday. At the end of the interview, the interviewer told "Sorry! Time's-up". Then itself I understood, I would not clear it. Next monday, I got a mail from the recruiter, that they can't move forward.

You have a string that consists of all types of characters, alphanumeric, special, uppercase and lowercase. The string should still tell me that it is a palindrome or not.

If you're a solid developer with years of experience working on high visibility products used by millions of people (and references to back it up) don't expect the interview process at Facebook to just work. It really comes down to how much you prepare yourself mentally to code within the context of an interview, and how much you study Career Cups as well as the other resources given to you by the recruiter. Sadly, you don't have to be a great developer at all. What's interesting is that none of these skills have been necessary during my 17 years of real world experience. I never had to write code on a whiteboard (except for other interviews) and I don't see how "writing code fast" should be considered a measurement of someone's productivity and code quality. That sort of thinking seems naive and haphazard to me. What frightens me is that I think Facebook truly believes they're "raising the bar" with this system. But they're not always hiring good people, and they're probably turning down a lot of great folks. The coding tests were super easy. Two were questions I've actually asked myself while conducting interviews for another company which was aimed towards entry level developers. I really wish they would have asked more challenging questions. I was able to finish them before the end of each panel, and with optimal solution. The design question they gave me actually aligned with something I developed and designed for a product used by millions. I felt good with how everything went at the end of the day, but somehow I failed at *both* coding and design. Interesting... whatever. Two of my friends--whom of which I mentored at my last company--were able to get offers at Facebook (same office, same interview process) but they were *not* the best coders nor the top performers, so if you get turned down at Facebook, don't take it seriously. They say there is some "randomness" in the interview, but it just seems strange that common sense didn't kick anywhere to question the obvious, or just the fact I was interviewed by a few people with only 5 years experience. Smart, but inexperienced (and somewhat arrogant) wanting to judge you with entry level coding questions. Half of the people that interviewed me didn't go through the interview process themselves. They were brought in by acquisitions. Specifically for a product that isn't doing very well right now. I was excited about the idea of working there initially, but after the interview, I wasn't so sure anyway. They do try to put a lot of emphasis on finding great developers, but many of the folks who interviewed me mentioned the codebase was a mess (probably from writing code so quickly and not thinking through it) And their open office (no cubes, no walls, just wires and computers everywhere) is a bit distracting. Not something genuinely appreciated by the people working there who used to have their own office. When you need to focus and get quality work done, there are only so many dedicated rooms to use and they're usually taken. Coupled with the fact that they're Seattle office is located in one of the worst traffic areas, I wasn't so sure I would have accepted anyway.

Asked a friend to refer me. Was contacted by a recruiter within two days. Quickly scheduled a tech-screen (essentially mini-ninja interview). After that came the on-site loop. 2 ninja, 2 pirate and 1 jedi interviews. Can't share specific questions, but plenty of other people did already. Unlike Google (interviewed with them also), Facebook seems to have a smaller question pool as one of the system design questions I got I've also seen on Glassdoor before. I recommend going through the information recruiters provide for interview preparation. Since Google and Facebook use very similar processes, "Stevey's Blog Rants: Get that job at Google" post is also quite relevant and useful. Know your data-structures, algorithms, practice solving problems for a few weeks and you should be in good shape. For system design questions, you will be asked to design Facebook-scale systems. Think data way beyond the scope of one machine, billions of items, thousands of requests per second. Hands on experience with such systems is of course "the king". In the absence of that - study distributed NoSQL systems, MapReduce and similar things and you should be in good shape. Overall I was very happy with the on-site interviews and the level of support Facebook recruiters and engineers provided me. This was probably the best interview experience that I've had. Having a competing offer handy will surely help you negotiate better compensation. Facebook seems to have an awesome culture. Deciding to reject their very generous offer for another one wasn't an easy call. One really can't go wrong by joining Facebook. Facebook is the only company that I know that provides interview feedback. Regardless whether you pass or not I recommend asking for it as it will help you get better.

Phone interview organization is not very good. The interviewer of one phone interview was absent, wasting one afternoon. Onsite organization is really good. All questions are ordinary, seems they more care about the communication b/w you and the interviewer, and that is probably the reason I got rejected. Feedback was really fast, 3 days after interview.

Had a phone call from recruiter, from my linked in profile. Recruiters were polite. Had a 1st round onsite interview, then got invited for the 2nd round. The questions will be of easy to average difficulty if some time is spent in brushing up the basic algorithms (from arrays to graphs). There in lies the problem, i,e. questions are not challenging. I answered all questions, with efficient solutions. There was no indication what so ever from the interviewer if there was anything wrong in my solutions. However, I'm guessing that since I couldn't finish in time to run through couple of examples, I got rejected. They don't give any grace period, if there's no time left, they end it abruptly. I guess they want to be fair to everyone. There was absolutely no feedback from any of the interviewers during the process, so it's hard understand what are they looking for, if anything is going wrong. This is true for the system-design as well. In my case looks like the decision was already made before lunch, the last round interviewers seemed completely un-interested. One of them was on the laptop typing continuously while I was presenting my solution. I'm sure they are able to find people who are able to code the solution in time. In my opinion, for most, this is only possible if you have already coded same or similar problem. There are tons of websites that lists the questions. Just spend enough time to practice them in coding. The interviews are less about problem solving ability, it's more about finishing the code in time. This process has worked from them and they will continue to follow it. Keep practicing writing the code, if you are lucky you'll get one of the questions that you are already familiar with. There was no feedback from the recruiter except I didn't get through.

The recruiter will send a link to websites that is meant to help you in preparation. If you spend enough time practicing those questions you can get through. Spend enough time writing code. The questions are not hard.   2 Answers

I was contacted via mail, a recruiter saw my linked in profile, over the phone he had a few basic iOS questions, after that I had another phone Interview with "live coding" again, some iOS questions, this time not so basic and a few problems to solve in the editor. At the end I had an Interview in person with 4 different guys. Mainly solving code problems on a whiteboard and few general questions. One of the interviews was about Architecture, that one was the toughest for me, because I never did something like that, In general I never had an Interview process like this.

Don't recall all the questions, but some of the questions had to do with general programming patterns and memory usage, and the problems were mainly about knowing algorithms and complexity with Big O notation, stuff like that   Answer Question

It was a typical Facebook interview with 2 phone screen rounds and then the onsite interviews. The phone interviews were both algorithm problems. The onsite rounds consisted of 2 coding, 1 system design and 2 behavioral+coding rounds. Lunch was included with an engineer and also a round with an engineering manager where I got the chance to ask as many questions about Facebook as I wanted without being evaluated. Questions in the coding round were not difficult (if you prepare well) and I was able to come up with the most efficient algorithm very quickly (later verified on the web) but - and here's the most important point - do not mess up the coding. You are expected to write perfect code, clean and bug-free. If you don't then you get axed. I didn't, so... What was disappointing is the fact that even though they say reaching the optimal solution is the most important thing and what they are evaluating is your thought process, they don't mean it. They want coders not engineers. Perfection is needed even if they tell you that it's not expected. Overall though I had a positive experience. All the people involved were very nice and smart. They did not make me feel unwelcome. I guess that's why people love working there.

The recruiter reached out from linkedin. Then I was scheduled for a phone interview. One week after the phone interview, I went on-site for 5 more 45 minutes one-on-one interviews. The first one dedicated 25 minutes on behavioral questions. i.e. challenge, conflict, etc. Including the first one, three interviews had white board coding algorithm questions. The other 2 interviews were on system design. The algorithm questions could be found on leetcode and careercup. The system design focused on distributed system. Practice was the key. Though, I had about 3 weeks to prepare for the interviews, as a father of 2 toddlers, I could only have a couple of hours here and there. It's pretty hard to study when another pair of little hands are also banging the keyboards at the same time. With limited time, I focused more on the algorithm questions and did well on the coding rounds. However, a week after the on-site, HR informed me the decision to reject my application due to the poor performance on the design round. I didn't think I did badly on the design round, but with a large candidate pool, I guess they could be very selective on hiring. It's really a devastating feeling to see your faith controlled by some 20-yo. Still, I feel with more practice on the system design questions, it's not impossible to get there.

First call with recruiter went well and after a few days they told me that I am being invited for an onsite interview with a single interviewer (instead of the phone screen). That interview went well and I was selected for the 2nd "pirate interview". They gave me enough material about what those interviews will be like and how to prepare for them. Everything good so far. I go for the 2nd interviews and I thought I did really well in the interviews. The only gotcha was that I had a lunch with an "interviewer" and that lunch took too long and it shortened the time I had available for my next coding interview. Unfortunately that lack of time resulted in me doing not so well in the coding interview (i.e. not being able to come up with a good working and efficient program) and apparently that resulted into it being a "no go" for me. :-(

Knowing that there are several methods of implementing it based on what is important (space, runtime) and what the goal is (for N > large values there's a constant time solution) Interviewer was unable to answer questions on the use and instead just told me to "just write something". I proceeded to implement the algorithm three ways.

I had one phone interview, and within a day after that my recruiter emailed me for a second phone interview, which she told me meant that I did okay but not great enough to get to the onsite immediately. I then had the second interview and thought I did horribly, but was invited to the onsite the next week. They only gave me one technical question in each round but in the first round after I had solved the first question, they gave me the same problem but with the constraint that I couldn't use a hashmap. Efficient process and quick response time from the recruiter, only complaints are that one phone interviewer had a very heavy accent and it made it very difficult to understand his feedback.

Internal recruiter contacted me. I had an initial phone screen with recruiter, including a couple basic technical questions, followed by a phone screen with an engineer where we coded on a collaborative editing Web site. Heard back the next day and we scheduled for an on-site. On-site consisted of 4 interviews, two technical, one architectural, and one behavioral. All interviews involved writing on a white board (actually just writing on the wall in a small room). Recruiters were consistently punctual and professional. Interviewers were friendly and helped keep the process low-stress.

I forgot some of the coding problems, but here are what I can remember. 1. move all 0s to the front of an integer array. 2. given a target and a sorted array, find the highest value smaller than the target. 3. given a 0-1 matrix, find the largest graph that is 1-connected. 4. design a system that can quickly return public accounts' activity data. For example, how many persons like/comment Taylor Swift's status. 5. In culture fit round, was asked many questions about how and why did you make this decision, what would you do in this case.

I arrived 5 minutes before the scheduled time and I waited for 20 minutes in the reception area. My scheduled interviewer could not make it and they found a young engineer to interview me instead. He is friendly and has worked in the industry for only 2 years. The conversation started almost like I was the interviewer as he introduced himself and told me what he does at Facebook for about 5 minutes. He asked me what I do in my current project and proceeded with a coding question. I solved the question in Java, tested edge cases, modularized the solution and discussed other potential solutions I could think of. We had a nice conversation and the interviewer agreed the solution given was good. He ended the interview by giving me the opportunity to ask any questions. They did not proceed to the next stage with me and I was surprised. Obviously I missed something and I do not know what that is. I asked the recruiter for feedback via e-mail and did not hear back.

Recruiter contacted me on Linkedin. I requested for in person interview in place of telephonic. Arranged a 1 hour interview at Menlo park office. Cleared the interview and was called for a six round interview. Interview was strange. Easy and not so complex algorithmic rounds. Not sure what is so special about those rounds or whether they were even part of the decision making. Interviewers were happy with the answers and not much corrections. Then there were these design rounds. One of the rounds was about designing location services. The interviewer was very knowledgeable. Pointed out my in-efficiencies with the choice of data-structure. Enjoyed it. Then started the real fun in the final round. An awesome interviewer with an awesome attitude. He spoiled my interview experience though. Asked me to design a messaging app system. Once the interviewer breaks the comfort zone, it would be a difficult place to stand. His expressions were horrible and sometimes I felt like saying "shut-up and listen first" which I didn't say obviously. When I mentioned that the server knows the ip address of client only when the server receives a packet from client. He said, there are a lot other ways it happens. I mentioned the only way is clients packet to the server. He made it an argument and finally I had to ask him to mention a way. He skipped the part and asked me to move on :-D Ignoring the final round, I actually enjoyed the interview process. No offer though :-)

The process starts out with contacting a recruiter. I was fortunate to have a friend who had previous interned at Facebook. From there, if they like the looks of your application, you will be given an online screening test on the hackerrank platform - 90 minutes. Advice is to keep calm, don't stress out, make sure you read the question. I solved this task with time to spare, and was able to move on with the process. I was given a phone interview, however did not perform well. The question was oriented heavily towards algorithm design and recursion, of which I could have solved, but unfortunately, given the stress, was unable to.

I can't discuss specifics due to NDA, but interview questions were neither overly difficult nor tricky. Check careercup and brush up on algorithms (string processing, binary trees, graphs, etc.). Practice coding fast (which potentially means forgetting good software engineering practices such as class design, refactoring as it will only slow you down). Establish rapport with your interviewer, remember to ask clarifying questions, talk through your thinking process and solutions and you'll do well. Hopefully better than me:) Best of luck!

I've applied through an employee referral and got a ping from the recruiter in about a week. After the initial chat with the recruiter to chat about FB, my interests and logistics, I got scheduled for the initial 45-minute screening. I was given two options for the screen, either phone/codeshare or an onsite visit (likely an option available for local candidates only). I chose the in-person option, and got an invite for a round of full day (5 total) within few hours after the initial screen. Facebook recruiters send interview prep materials to the candidates on what to expect, what to brush up on, as well as some suggestions tailored to a particular candidate's weak-ish spots (in my case it was the speed of coding). I knew what to expect going in and felt well prepared on this front. Initial screen was algorithm + coding. Nothing overly challenging. Onsite consisted of 5 interviews (+ informal lunch) covering: 1) One "Jedi" interview with a hiring manager testing behavior / culture fit + warm-up coding. Prepare to talk about past experience, career goals, as well as several "tell me about the time when..." questions. 2) One "Pirate" interview: System design portion of the interview. There are great resources on Quora on suggestions on how to prepare and what to pay attention too. 3) Three "Ninja" interviews focusing on algorithm + coding. I actually have seen all of the questions I got asked at Facebook before, but that did not help me as ultimately the reason for rejection was cited as not being able to come up with optimal solutions and code fast enough. Got an phone call from the recruiter in about a week+few days after the interview telling me the unfortunate news. I think I had to wait few extra days because of the July holidays and typically the process is faster. Culture: I did find some of the junior Facebook engineers conducting my interview a bit arrogant and cocky, but nothing too alarming. All in all, I had a positive interview experience. I wish the interview loop was better tailored towards someone more senior, e.g. less emphasis on coding, more on design. Current interview process makes it seem they hire code monkeys.

Can't disclose due to NDA. But as mentioned above, the coding questions are really straightforward and of merely average difficulty. It's the system design ("Pirate") questions that can be really, really challenging. Definitely spend a good portion of your time preparing for the latter!   Answer Question

I started off with a standard technical phone screen with a Facebook engineer. It was a simple coding exercise with two questions of surprisingly low difficulty. I cleared this easily. Facebook's on-site interview process is far more rigorous, though. Each 45-min interview has a clearly defined role, intended to test you from multiple different angles. Specifically, I went through: - 2 "Ninja" interviews (coding & algorithms) - 2 "Pirate" interviews (system design) - 1 "Jedi" interview (behavioral & simple coding) plus lunch with a Facebook engineer. The "Ninja" and "Jedi" interviews were straightforward. I hadn't seen the coding questions before, but they were not particularly hard. I would rate them as being of just average difficulty, pretty similar to the whiteboard coding questions asked at most other major Silicon Valley tech companies. And the behavioral section of the "Jedi" interview was just a friendly chat about my resume and my past experiences. However, the "Pirate" interviews were what killed me. Both "Pirate" interviews involved being asked to propose and discuss a design for existing features on Facebook. The interviewers were extremely meticulous and questioned me on virtually every last detail of my design decisions. In particular, they focused a lot on how huge datasets should be stored and accessed to support extremely large-scale distributed systems. Even though I am already working on web-scale systems in my current job, I was nonetheless still way under-prepared for this level of technical challenge and scrutiny. My advice to all prospective candidates is to spend most of your time preparing for the "Pirate" interviews. The coding questions aren't hard, but the system design questions will likely stretch you to your limit! (Unless you're a fresh grad--they don't ask "Pirate" questions to fresh grads. Lucky folks!) Additional side note: interestingly, my Facebook recruiter actually gave me detailed post-mortem feedback on each and every one of my interviews. They are the only major Silicon Valley company I know that does this, so major kudos to them for being so considerate.

Took multiple months as I was not available. The recruiter did an excellent job in making sure that I take the interview. The interview took 45 mins and started with details about my previous work experience. That took about 20 mins and then I was left with 20 mins for the programming question. He gave me a problem related to BST. Obviously I need to draw the tree etc and he cannot see that on phone interview. I started with multiple approaches and he told specifically what I need to do eg. give only recursive solution, you can only store few things no extra space. In the end i was able to solve with a minor hint and he was also telling me to fix bugs as I was coding as well indent code as per his standards. Overall it was a good experience but I did not get the offer as they are looking for people who can code in like 10 mins as I was able to code in 15-20 mins. They want bug free code and will only go forward with the best candidate. I think even if you do a minor mistake you are out as there is someone else who will solve it perfectly so try to solve it perfectly :) Another important lesson is if you get option of phone v/s in person interview, I will say go for in person interview as it gives the interviewer the chance to see what you are doing on paper verses imagining that over phone.

Applied for an iOS position - was initially contacted via LinkedIn. Overall really enjoyed the process. Was quite drawn out due to personal circumstances. Interviewed from Australia, initially a phone screening interview (5 fairly basic iOS questions, understanding blocks and ARC), followed by 2 technical phone interviews (algorithmic coding questions plus verbal conversations around past work experience and also technical iOS questions. After passing in these two phone interviews they flew me out to Menlo Park for a day of interviews. There were 5 interviews, one initial chat to warm up, talking about past experience, working relationships, etc, and a brief coding question on the whiteboard. There were 3 more technical interviews of same format as the initial phone interviews. Plus one interview on designing scalable iOS app architecture for a simple app. I really enjoyed the process and found the recruiters very helpful and friendly. Going and visiting Facebook HQ was great and as the reviews say all the people were great. Recommend doing for the experience. Getting an offer is tough. For me it came down to not being quick enough in answering the questions in the onsite technical interviews. They weren't overly difficult but they want you to move fast, and I tended to take my time and discuss with the interviewers which I believe worked against me. The other aspect was a general lack of experience (I have 18 months experience), and this reflected especially in the iOS design interview. Hope this helps others considering going through the process! I definitely recommend it!

Remaining three people were very good in communication. After on-site interview, facebook requested for yet another coding phone interview. Post onsite phone interview is what went wrong with me. This person had poor interview skills. He asked me an advanced algorithm question about graph/tree traversal (search for "same fringe problem concurrency" and you will know what I am talking about). I gave a natural solution which was not space efficient, but interviewer was looking for a specific solution he had in mind. I lost the deal to this question. I would give thumbs up to recruiters handling interview process. I think they are one of the best in the industry.

After submitting my resume and answering a few questions on past projects, job preferences, etc. I had two Skype interviews on algorithmic questions. The problems posed were quite fair and had to be solved in a programming language of choice in an online editor. After that, I was invited to an on-site interview in London (expenses paid) with three more one on one interviews. Two of them were once more on coding, this time on a white board. The other one also had a small coding part but also included questions on previous projects, team behavior etc.

Met recruiter at the Facebook offices, she showed me around. Because I was applying for an engineering position, it started on the engineering floor, which isn't too big. Nice offices but nothing super special, she did mention they were moving fairly soon. After the brief tour went down to the 2nd floor and went to a small room for the technical screen. An engineer came in and for a minute or two asked me about my background and work experience. Then went and asked me two technical questions. The first one was pretty straight forward, but I spent a long time explaining my thought process and debugging and everything. (As a ton of sites say you do). Second one was a bit more of a puzzle question and stumbled a little on it, basically it was a binary search algorithm. Unfortunately a miscommunication at the beginning of the question caused me to try to think of it in a different direction, but eventually got it and realized time was up so I quickly coded the solution and debugged it, but didn't explain myself probably because I knew the time was up. Ultimately got both questions right with a minor stumble and then was not asked for a further interview, so I really have no idea why, and unfortunately I understand for legal ramifications why they can't tell me. However not getting past the screen was unexpected.

There were four interviews, two about engineering, one about architecture, one about career. The engineering interviews where what you would expect: The questions were geared to find out whether you understand time and space complexity. The hardest one was the architecture part, because it was not obvious to me what to prepare there. Facebook is such a huge company, doing architecture on Facebook scale is something that I think only Facebook or one of the other big companies can prepare you to do.

First, there was a phone screen with the recruiter, a technical screen (either phone or on site, candidate's choice), and an on site. The recruiter was very professional and helpful, describing the process and the engineering culture at Facebook. They were very flexible in scheduling both the phone screen and onsite. The phone screen was a standard technical phone screen, with the difficulty dialed up slightly. The solutions allowed were constrained (typically, constant space). After I presented my solution, we discussed its complexity. The on site was very similar. The interview was very CS heavy. The questions asked relied on the knowledge of the properties of many data structures, including ones that are less often used. I can't recall any technical trivia questions being asked; all the questions surrounded a problem with an implementation that had to be coded on the white board. Parallelism and threads were also covered. I gave my answers in Python, and except for one interviewer that asked for a solution using Java, all accommodated. There was one design and architecture review which as different and a lot of fun. I was asked to design a system for a current feature of Facebook. The interviewers were great to interact with. I had a couple offers that were exploding, and they said they would be able to get a decision back quick. But there was an offsite, so the decision was delayed a few days. I withdrew when I accepted another offer. To put it in context, my other offers were exploding within 72 hours of the on site, so it was a tall order and it's to their credit that they tried. I left very impressed. When I'm looking for a position in the future, I'll definitely check them out.

The overall process took less than 3 weeks. The interviewers are friendly and will give hints in between to keep you getting closer to solution. This was a 1 on 1 interview and coding had to done on white paper. The questions are straight forward but need to take into consideration all corner cases when giving your algorithm. Also the code needs to be clean, so think carefully before starting to just code. Also practice writing code on white paper as when you are doing it you tend to scratch out code in between and that reflects bad.

I was first contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. We had a quick chat on the phone before he scheduled a phone screen with an engineer. I don't remember the question from the phone screen, but it was a standard coding screening type interview of about 30 minutes. There was a little bit of time for other questions, but the focus was entirely on coding ability. A few days later, the recruiter contacted me again and arranged for an on site interview in Seattle. I had four approximately hour long interviews with a shorter lunch interview part of the way through. Although the interviews were themed (e.g., "pirate", "ninja", etc.), all were very focused on coding except for one which focused on architecting a system. Several of the coding questions required figuring out the trick underlying the problem in order to get a good solution quickly. Many other companies have stopped asking these kinds of questions since they've found they are not very good at identifying the best people to hire. I felt like I reached satisfactory solutions for each of the questions, but based on feedback I received from the recruiter afterward it was clear they would have preferred me to have been faster. Everybody I interviewed with was friendly and fairly organized, but the sole emphasis on coding and problem solving questions turned me off to the interview process. While it's important to suss out a candidate's technical abilities, these questions don't do a very good job of that. Moreover, they completely ignore other qualities a senior engineer needs to succeed such as cultural fit, leadership abilities, ability to motivate/influence others, having vision, etc. Overall it felt like the process was overly tailored towards entry level college hires instead of mid-career professionals with existing experience. I did not get an offer, but would not have accepted anyways.

Was contacted by facebook recruiter. I thought I will give it a try. I selected in person tech screen vs phone interview since I think it is much easier to express yourself in person, plus there is whiteboard. Especially, if it is a graph or tree problem, easier to draw on whiteboard. I had to sign NDA unfortunately, so won't be able to share the exact question. But for a software engineer (not senior), the question was pretty hard to solve in 40 minutes. Backtracking was required and the best solution to the problem is n! (n factorial). So if you haven't heard of the problem before, it is quite likely you will spend time just on finding an optimal solution before jumping to code. That's what I did. However, I was able to code most of the solution and interviewer seemed happy. He himself told me that. Interviewer was pretty nice. He answered my questions pretty well and seemed down to earth, only thing I am not sure is the choice of question. I was informed that they will not move ahead with the on-site round, which is what I expected.

Recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn. Had a chat on the phone and decided to mutually move ahead. The first round was a basic phone round with a software engineer ( nothing too difficult ). Cleared it and came onsite. As known, the pattern onsite is one behavioral interview with a coding question followed by 2 coding interviews and 1 design interview. Will not disclose the onsite questions due to NDA. The behavioral interview person was yawning throughout the 40 minutes and the coding interview question asked at the end of the behavioral interview was one of those questions which you either know/ don't know. I was expected to know the solution and code it in 10 minutes which pretty much negated the problem solving aspect of it. The 2 coding round questions were pretty standard. However, one of the questions was a text book question and I stated that I knew the solution to that question following which the question asked was way too tough to be solved in 25 minutes on the white board. Similarly the design interview involved a lot of math and was more difficult than coming up with an architecture . This had been informed prior to the interview though. Overall : The interview experience was mixed probably because most of the questions seemed to be the type of questions that one would/ wouldn't know. There was very little problem solving aspect to the whole process and sadly that is pretty much the case with some interviews for tech companies

I was contacted by a recruiter and asked the normal job / career stuff. An interviewer callef back and asked a lot of simple Linux networking questions that were pretty much to filter out people who didn't know what they were talking about. The questions were things like what port number various services were on and what simple Unix commands did. I then had a call scheduled with an engineer to do a test using a shared writing space. It was a very annoying tool to use and I had a bit of trouble using it because I'm an emacs guy and this was a very different In Bowser editor. Anyway, the problem was to recursively copy a directory structure to a remote file system using an api. My reviewer and I went through the solution I made and we confirmed it worked.

Facebook's interview process is to start you off with a one hour high pressure interview to solve two problems. If you pass that test then you come back for a full day. Facebook is well known for their interview arrogance and it proved to be quite true. The first part was a "white board architecture" problem where "want to see what you are thinking" - which is definitely not true. What they want to see is the exact answer/response that they are looking for. The second part is a coding question where you have to write code on a whiteboard using the language of your choice. The interviewer will have asked this question over and over and over again but then act like they are such an expert on the topic. You as the interviewer are going to have to think about it - since you do not have the same luxury as the interviewer. It is a typical facebook, google type interview where they claim to "set the bar high" to make themselves appear like a dream place to work.

I applied online to the Facebook website in January. Facebook was really, absurdly fast for me. For the online application, they responded in about a week, and I scheduled the interview in the next week. After two phone interviews, they emailed me back in the same day. The interviewers were programmers, and they made me feel very comfortable. With other companies, I sometimes would get interviewers who knew nothing about programming, and it made it hard for me to talk about my projects without accidentally going into too much depth or jargon that they likely wouldn't understand. It was really comfortable talking with the Facebook interviewers, and it was easy to ask questions at the end because I knew they'd know about stuff like the Oculus or what programming life was like there. Like many others have said, I would highly recommend Cracking the Coding Interview. The questions were relatively easy, and two of them were ones I already saw on this site. My interviewers really liked that I spoke all of my thoughts out loud while I was programming.

I was contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn. The time between indicating to the recruiter that I was interested to the date of the final set of onsite interviews was about 1 month. I'm local to Facebook HQ, so for the initial screening interview I was given the option to do it over the phone or onsite (I chose the latter). The interviewer asked me about my recent work history, and asked me to solve a couple of coding problems. I returned a couple of weeks later for 5 onsite interviews, which consisted of 2 coding, 2 design, and 1 fit interview. Most of the interviews were good experiences, except for one where I unfortunately got stuck on a problem and the interviewer just sat there watching me while I struggled.

I applied through career fair at my university. They hosted a pre-interview dinner so you can meet with your recruiter/on-campus interviewer. The next day I had my 45-min interview and it was a pleasant one. The question wasn't that hard and I didn't need any extra hint to solve it. After that they sent me an onsite request (wait for 1 week), then I came to their HQ in MPK a week later. Had the interview by noon, then a good tour around campus. The onsite question was much easier, as I think if you're invited to onsite then be confident that you have a really good chance to get in. After 2 business day I got the offer from FB. The compensation is really huge and very hard to decline. As for tip, I would say get as much rest and be well prepared for the interview. They ask basic question but you need to have a clear mind to solve them comfortably, and please try as hard as you can to explain the thought process.

The interview process for me was uberly long. I wasn't planning on applying to Facebook, but a recruiter reached out to me mid-december on LinkedIn. I thought "what the heck, it's a great company" and got back to her the next day, but she was leaving for the XMas break. No more communication until early Jan. Connecting on the phone was a pain, as first she didn't call until 15 minutes after she said she would. I had stopped standing by the phone and went to email her when she did call, so missed it. We emailed and set something up for an hour later. This time she called 30 minutes late. No apologies or anything. Sigh. She advised that I put all of my other interviews before the Facebook one so that I could get practice, and then signed me up for a free interview review course they run. I went and things were all great, so I told them I was ready. Queue another 2 week pause while they tried to answer a question I had asked before scheduling me. When I finally made it onsite for an interview (mid-late feb), I had expected it to be a full day of interviewing, but instead it was a 30 minute screen before I could do the *actual* interview. In all fairness, I should have seen that coming. But anyways, did the screen and got a response before I had even left the parking that they wanted to schedule my full interview. I also got a call from my recruiter that afternoon to give me interview feedback. I thought that was awesome, as most people don't do that. I can't say how useful it was as I had no negative feedback from my interviewers and her advice was just "wow, keep doing whatever you just did!" but it sounds like it could be useful if things don't go perfectly the first time around. Anywho, by this time I had multiple other offers with deadlines on them. I went ahead and scheduled the final round interview for the following week, but ended up canceling the day before as I had decided to go with another company. This seemed to irk my recruiter, despite the fact that she was the one who told me to interview with other companies first and I had been upfront about that and the associated timelines during the whole process. When initial contact and end offer are 2.5 months apart, you can't expect someone to be sitting idle that whole time... The only reason I still rank this as a positive experience is because I had a secondary recruiter I worked with coordinating onsite logistics (the girl who first contacted me was out of state) and he was awesome. If any of you get the chance, work with Charlie. He's direct and super straight forward and knows that candidates are people with multiple options and treats you as such. I do a lot of mentoring and will certainly be sending any of my mentees who expresses interest in Fbook Charlie's way; he's a real gem.

One of the questions I got was around bit manipulation and built on itself by layers (i.e. how would you do x? ok, say you have a function for x, how would you do this new thing y?).

I had two coding phone interviews but did not move forward to the team matching interview. For each round, a engineer first introduced himself ask a little bit about your experience. Then they go to coding questions directly. I perform good at first round but not that good at second round.

The coding questions are not that hard for both two rounds. In the first round, the two questions are (1) return the sum of the k-largest digits ([0-9]) in the array (2) implement a LRU cache (least recently used) In the second round, the two questions are (1) return the index of the largest element, if more than one element reaches max, pick one unifromly at random; (2) clone a graph. the graph is directed, unweighted and not necessarily fully connected.

I didn't end up getting an offer. Due to NDA I cannot explicitly write down the questions, but look at the last 150 questions in Glassdoor and CareerCup and you'll do fine (I did fine in the coding rounds, get to that in a bit). Usual advice: Do a lot of white-boarding for questions and be ready to talk extensively about your projects and architecture and design. Screening Round: I applied to Facebook by getting connected to a recruiter through a colleague and friend. The process started in Seattle and I opted for a in-person onsite interview for the screening round (they have this option for locals in Seattle/California). The interview went well i.e. I figured out how to solve the question in optimal time and space complexity. I made some mistakes here and there while writing the solution down but the interviewer didn't seem to mind. Contrary to what I had heard, he wasn't too anal about syntax (also helped that I write in C# he wasn't very familiar with it) Onsite Round: I received an email from the recruiter that they wanted to move forward and call me onsite. I was like, cool! I took around 2 weeks to prepare and also tried to do design questions. I felt a bit under prepared around design and tried to make up for it in the last few weeks by watching videos around cloud architecture (and open source stuff like Hadoop, Kafka and Storm). Onsite was pretty straightforward. First round was a career fit/discussion and I did pretty well (I think). It was mainly some behavioral questions and a lot diagrams around the architecture in my current and previous projects. Second round was the one that I messed up. The question was around designing an existing Facebook feature (as a hint, think about the various add-dons you see on FB and instagram like Chat, Search, latest friend related news or popular links). When you really dig into designing this feature, its quite complicated and requires a reasonable amount of knowledge around distributed data storage etc. etc. You need to nail this round to get into Facebook (in my personal opinion). I'm guessing they will adjust their expectations based on your years of experience. There was a lunch which was informal and two more coding rounds where they asked questions that were very similar to the ones I had practiced. I made some silly mistakes here and there but again (due to practice) came up with optimal time/space complexity answers. Got my result exactly one week from the my onsite date. No offer. But learnt a lot.

No different to others mentioned here: contacted via LinkedIn, one screening call (45mins), then on-site with 4 x 45mins interviews. Overall, the algorithm questions are not particularly hard. I have interviewed with FB twice, and both times felt the sessions went well (although considerably better the second time), but no offer either time. You won't get detailed enough feedback to know where you might have tripped up, if anywhere, though. From their point of view, I think this is understandable, but makes it harder to deal with the rejection; if you had fouled up every session you would feel better than if you basically answered all the questions, with seemingly positive feedback from each interviewer, yet not got an offer... As noted elsewhere, it's probably best to be stoic about the whole thing and accept that they have so many candidates they probably apply a "benefit of the doubt" policy that works against in their favour; ie. I would imagine they employ a sort of "thumb up", "thumb down" policy. They are, however, very pleasant and expect to have a positive experience of the process even if the result is not what you might want yourself.

One session of higher-level design, the rest are all standard algorithm sessions. All of this is explained in advance, so no surprises. One on-site session is a more traditional interview.   Answer Question

Here I was asked a medium difficulty coding question (See bellow). After a week I was told they wanted to take me into On-Site interviews. Over there, in San Francisco, I was received by the recruiter and he took me to the interview room. I had 4 interviews, 3 coding + 1 system design. After a week they told me I wasnt selected. Honestly, I dont know what they focus on when interviewing, cause I got the solution for all the coding questions, just struggled a little bit in the design one, and nevertheless, I didnt get an offer.

Don't waste your time with Facebook unless you're desperate. Like the other people mentioned here, there is something fishy going on with Facebook interviews. I really did well with the onsite interview and they told me that they passed on my application with no feedback after 2 weeks. I've gone through two phone interviews and then an onsite interview with 3 coding (ninja), 1 design (pirate) and 1 cultural/coding (jedi) interview. I have heard that they usually do only 2 ninja interviews, but I got 3 for some reason. The coding interviews are pretty standard. You either got it right or not. Explain everything clearly as you code it, because they may not understand your solution even if it's an optimal solution. Be prepared for follow up questions after that. Since I got the coding questions right, I got asked a second one each time. So on a successful interview be prepared to do 7 coding questions (again 5 in most cases).

I cannot go in specifics because of the NDA, but they are standard coding questions, which you can find on Leetcode or coding interview prep books.   Answer Question

Awful overall process. Had a phone interview and then on-site. On site interview was too generic. Facebook followed up with asking for references, then academic transcript which took two weeks. Then Facebook asked me to solve a coding puzzle and after one month, said no. The overall process was unorganized and length and even if I had gotten a job offer, I don't think it was pleasant in any way. In contrast, Google's interview process was much smoother and they replied within a week of on-site. Facebook should learn a thing or two from Google.

I applied through a referral, 1 Skype interview (2 were scheduled but I didn't make it past the first one). The interviewer briefly introduced himself and asked me a coding question straight away. I chose to use Java. No behavioral questions, just 1 coding question. Contrary to what most people have said, I got an interviewer who wasn't very friendly. He was there to do his job. Plain and simple.

Before I get to the question I just want to say that the interviewer had a very thick accent (I'm an international candidate, BTW), and that made it really difficult for me to understand what he wanted me to do. This isn't me being bitter. I'm saying this so that I present a very honest opinion about my interview. That being said, the question wasn't something that can be found online or in most books, I was given 2 functions String recv() and String ReadLine() [ both these DO NOT take arguments]. recv() generates some string (Example:"123\n45\n6789"). ReadLine() should read the string being returned by recv() and print all characters until the first \n. After that it should read the recv() string again and print the next characters until the 2nd \n. Example: recv(): "123\n45\n6789"                ReadLine(): "123" //first call of ReadLine                ReadLine(): "45" // second call of ReadLine However, the next sequence now doesn't have a \n. So, once the end of the string is hit, the ReadLine() function must call recv() again, and append all characters until it reads a \n. Continuing the above example: ReadLine():6789abcde //Third call of ReadLine                                                   recv():"abc"// still no \n...so you must call recv() again                                                   recv():"de\n" The commented sections are my explanations (the interviewer didn't give any such things). I've explained the problem as clearly as I can. Unfortunately, the interviewer kept overwriting his examples, and (I have to emphasize this) his accent made it really hard to understand just what he wanted out of this program.   1 Answer

I was referred to Facebook by a friend who works there and was contacted by a member of HR about a week later. We set up a date for a 45-minute technical phone interview which was to be held a week and a half later. For the actual interview, I was first asked a couple of generic questions about myself and Facebook before moving on to the technical questions. There were two programming questions. For the first question, I first described what my algorithm would be, then discussed time and space complexity before finally implementing it. My interviewer didn't have anything to say about my answer and we simply moved on. I took the same basic approach to the second question; described my algorithm, discussed space/time complexity, and then implemented it. However, after discussing the space and time complexity for my potential solution, my interviewer asked me if I saw any draw-backs to my algorithm. I told him that it used a lot of extra space, and he asked if I could think of a more efficient (space-wise) solution. I thought about it for awhile, but unfortunately blanked out. He then suggested I just go ahead and implement my algorithm. The last 5 or so minutes of the 45 minute interview were devoted to me asking questions. I asked a few, and the interview was over. I received a generic rejection email 3 days later.

For each involved finding the solution (easy to optimal) and then write code optimal solution. I did this pretty well as I had prepared for data structures and algos. They immediately called me for full day onsite interview. Again I prepared lot on data structures, algorithms and related problem solving. And boom..that was my mistake. I forgot to focus on system side (locking, synchronization, deadlock) in detail. 5 interviewers, 45 min each. No on asked on data structures/algo. Two interviewers asked on locking related question, 1 design, 1 manager and last guy did combo of everything. Mostly I screwed up on locking related questions as I took many hint and long time... sigh.. Everyone was professional. Communication was prompt and fast!

I was contacted by Facebook recruiter. The entire process was efficient and quick. After the initial phone call with the recruiter, I received an email with details about interview process and how to prepare for technical interview in general, which I think it was pretty nice. I was scheduled for the phone interview one week after. The phone interview includes behavior questions and online coding and it took about 45 minutes. It started with typical introduction and then I was asked to talk about one of the works/projects listed on my resume and why I would pick to talk about that particular one. The interviewer didn't seem to impress about the project I picked to talk about. There were a couple of behavior questions (i.e. conflict resolution etc). Then the longest part of the phone interview was a coding question. You can pick any language you'd like, which is a plus. The coding question was not difficult, but clearly not an easy one, requires some thoughts. Be prepared to provide test cases. I had it working but not covering many edge cases. At the end, you can ask the interviewer any question, which I did. It sounded like the interviewer didn't seem to be excited about the current work, but kind enough to give me details about the challenging parts and current interesting problems the interviewer has been working on. I heard back the interview result from the recruiter exactly one week after.

I applied online and heard back the next day. They gave me study material and resources to prepare for a phone interview. The phone interview is tough. The level of difficulty is not bad but the pressure of being on the phone and having to code in a short period of time may cloud your mind.

I received two questions. The first was print out all possible strings that a phone number can produce. For instance: 2 -&gt; A,B,C and 3 -&gt; D,E,F. So if the input is 23, then the output should be "AD, AE, AF, BD, etc.." The second question was if you had multiple points (x,y), find the n closest points to the origin (0,0).   5 Answers

I was contacted by a recruiter, I came onsite for an initial screen. I thought the interviewer was very nice, and the question was reasonable. However, the frustrating part for me was that for the given question, there were a few different ways to solve it. From my perspective, it seemed that the approach I used to solve the question was not what the interviewer had in mind. I understand that you should listen to an interviewer when they interrupt you or give you hints, but to me it seemed like the "hints" were basically from the perspective of "you're not solving this the way I would solve it, even though both of our solutions are O(n)". The result was that I was basically having to write out a problem on a white board and constantly have my train of thought interrupted. The interruptions were unnecessary, and I had to clarify to the interviewer that my intent would indeed work. Example interruption: Interviewer: "That array index is giving you the same result as the other value" Me: "No, that's a different variable name" Interviewer: "Oh, oops. Continue" or Interviewer: "Wait, why are you replacing the for loop with a while loop?" Me: "Because I want to be able to manipulate the cursor directly" Interviewer: "Oh, ok. Continue" In the above statement, it's clear that the usual method of solving the problem did not involve a while loop (but it could be done to solve the problem). After my solution, the interviewer explained the most straightforward solution to the problem which basically leveraged the constraints of the problem itself, and after seeing that then of course the problem was trivial to implement. So to me, it seemed like the question was more of a riddle than a coding exercise, which I believe to be a bad interview question, and at my current company it's accepted as the WORST type of interview question. It was rather embarrassing for me to be turned down, especially on just the initial screen, but another qualm I had was that screens are generally meant to filter out candidates that can't code at all, not candidates who are questionable in their skills (from my perspective my skills aren't questionable, but clearly I did not give my best performance in this screen). To me it felt as though the interviewer in this case did not have much experience. While I was answering the questions that were given to me, I was having to explain a few quirks to the python language that the interviewer clearly did not know i.e. "Oh, I didn't know you could compare dictionaries like that". For that to be said, I can only infer that the ONLY thing this interviewer was looking for is if I answer the question that was given to me in the exact way they wanted it solved.

The interview had a rather easy question, but I had a problem quickly writing code on the whiteboard - something that I've hard ever done in my programming career. Nor do I have a lot of interview experience in the US. Which I did warn them about. Still got a reply later saying I failed because of "coding performance". Whatever that means.

Applied through an employee referral. Failed on a phone screening. The interviewer spoke extremely fast. In addition, there was a strong reverberation (looks like she spoke in a big room) on a line. As a result, I mostly guessed her questions. Even when I asked to repeat a question a few times she didn't change anything in her speech. I've had phone interviews before and they were good enough. But this one was a hell. Besides a few usual questions about previous experience and a reason for changing a job, there were only 2 technical questions, both about complexity of algorithms (O-notations), i.e. quite useless, in other words. I think I answered them correctly (Anyway it makes no sense to remember them). It took about 20 minutes. Overall, it was terrible experience. The worst thing, I failed it not due to lack of some technical skills but just because of communication issues. I have a lot of Java experience (they had open positions for that) and some other modern tools and technologies, as well as I'm opened for learning new technologies. But, unfortunately, I haven't had any chance to demonstrate it on any technical phone interviews. Never again.

Process: This is for undergrad full-time software candidates in USA. Submitted resume at college career fair. Got email about on-campus interviews. At this stage, there are 3 possible outcomes: onsite invitation, a phone interview for an additional chance, or reject. I was invited to onsite interview. Onsite was a "University Day" that included three interviews (not four like they said in the email) before lunch and then a tour, new-hire panel, etc after lunch. All interviews were 45-mins length. Interviews themselves: On-campus interview: 3 coding questions. I don't remember signing any NDA at this point so, the questions were k-Nearest Points to Origin, finding a substring, and 3-sum. On-site interview: 3 interviews, 45 mins each. 1st interview: 2 coding questions. 2nd interview: behavioral questions (about team conflict, etc.) and a coding question. 3rd interview: 2 coding questions. Coding questions were easy and required *no knowledge* of special algorithms or data structures (such as graphs, DP, trees, etc). Recursion and strings were common. I did not get an offer from Facebook; however, I received offers from other companies. The interview questions themselves were considerably easier at Facebook than those asked at Google, LinkedIn, MS, Amazon, etc. Since the questions are not very hard, my guess is the decision is based upon fit and most importantly how *quickly* you were able to arrive at your solution and how *perfect* your code was. Make sure you focus and are confident. Advice: practice the easier questions and practice coding them. Also, looking at some of the other experiences on Glassdoor, it looks like a majority of the questions are re-used.

I got the opportunity through internal referral. I passed an technical phone screening and was invited to an on-site. I had 5 interviews in total. Two coding, two system design, one with manager (on PhD research + a quick coding exercise). The technical questions were not too difficult, but I was unprepared for the system design problems. One of the interviewers kept walking around in the room and was really distracting and annoying. I couldn't focus on solving the problem and didn't do well in that session. The interviewing schedule was not the best. I was scheduled to have lunch at 2pm PST, but considering I'm from a couple time zones east of PST, I was already way too hungry to have lunch at that time.

Was contacted by a recruiter. Set up a phone interview; had weird telephone problems, couldn't understand my interviewer very well. Did some general algorithm questions in Python that were well-suited to a phone interview, but wasn't pleased with my performance overall. Recruiter contacted me back to do a second phone screen - said there "wasn't enough of a signal" the first time. Apparently this is not common. Second phone screen had problems with the collaborative edit software we used for coding - I had to stop, copy, and repaste my code several times for some reason. Again, the questions were well-suited to the format of the interview. Thought I did better but no better than an average performance, probably.

Facebook came to my campus career fair where I turned in my resume. I had an onsite interview in New York which went well. It was completely a technical interview with only programming. I was asked 2 questions - the first was a simple reverse a signed integer, the second was a harder pattern matching problem that could be solved using a prefix tree. I was invited to a second on-site interview in Menlo Park. It was a long flight across the country and in hindsight totally not worth the time wasted - I skipped classes and turned in homework late as a result. The on-site was awful. My interviewer showed up late and then proceeded to ask me a very simple question about printing the paths to nodes in a binary tree. Coded it up with some minor corrections (since I was white boarding and you miss some stuff when you're face is glued to a wall). He then extended the question but cut me off because we ran out of time (this was completely his fault since he showed up a good 15 minutes late). They proceeded to give me a tour of the campus and talk with current engineers. It would have been fun if it hadn't been for the bad interview. Overall, I got the feeling that they're a large company and are definitely not as agile as they were a couple of years ago. Engineers were very complacent and talked more about their great perks than personal growth. In the end, I think I got caught in the interview anti-loop and had some poor luck. Promptly rejected. I really wish I hadn't wasted 48 hours flying for that sad excuse of an interview.

Gave my resume at my university's tech fair and heard back two months later to schedule an interview. My interviewer was honestly pitiful. He was disinterested and rarely spoke (several times I thought the call got cut off). He didn't seem to care about me at all, but simply if I could answer the technical question. When given the chance to ask him questions about his experience he gave short answers that gave me a poor impression of Facebook as an employer: goal oriented (as in, finish or die trying), regimented, and not user-centric. The technical question was difficult as well, and I got the impression that asking questions of him was discouraged. I was stopped early, but I think I got the answer later after the interview was over (though I will never be sure as the spec was not 100% clear).

1 Behavior/Past experience 2 Ninja 3 Lunch (not rated) 4 Design 5 Ninja The behavior interview is about 1 hour, just talking about your past and current experience and projects you have done, plus a 15 mins coding test. first Ninja is an opening question, essentially creating your own question based on a scenario and do some coding. My experience was really good so you have the flexibility to design questions you are familiar with. Lunch was chat with a senior team lead, relax and get to know what you want to know. Design was easy for me, since I have done a similar system at my current job. the last ninja really sucked, the question is about a really unconventional event processing model using "pulling" instead of standard "push" model (like Storm), and the interviewer does not talk much and was not happy when I proposed the much simpler and intuitive push model. I failed on this one.

The second ninja (coding) test was about event processing system using pulling model, which literally no one in the industry is using.   5 Answers

I was referred by a friend. Whole process took a week in a half - due to a pending deadline on my part. I had a phone interview and was then invited onsite at the end of the week. The onsite interview was composed of 3 interviews. They were typical questions of any other technical interview questions - although slightly more tree-heavy than other companies. On Monday I was contacted asking to provide references. I thought I had it in the bag because of this but Tuesday evening I was rejected. I know that they were strong and wouldn't cause my rejection. So I guess references are asked for before the onsite interviews are processed?

I signed an NDA so won't disclose the exact questions - but I'd practice up on tree traversals before interviewing   Answer Question

A friend referred me and then I got contacted by a recruiter sometime during September. Arranged for a phone interview two weeks later, and two hours after my phone interview, I was told that I could go onsite. During onsite there are 4 rounds of interviews. 3 are completely coding, the other is half behavior and half coding. Most questions are not hard and can be found on Glassdoor or other sort of programming interview preparing materials. Definitely easier than Google interview questions. I thought I did pretty well during the onsite (better than phone). Answered all but one question they asked me, and I did not think there was a lot of bugs. No idea why I did not get in, but since I am really not even half of a world-class developer, at this stage I understand luck is more involved than skills.

After that, I was asked to have an onsite interview with them in one of the three locations: New York city, Seattle or Menlo Park. I chose to visit the Seattle office. The process for onsite interview is inviting and I had a good time on that day. It was a university day, on which that FB invites all the university students to interview with them on the same day.

Applied online. Got an email from a recruiter. Easy,efficient and painless process. The recruiters are really quick and will let you know the smallest of details regarding the interview. Had a technical phone screen with an engineer from a similar team. Had to code on collabedit. Was initially asked some OOP concepts,Data structure questions. The coding question was easy and i solved it correctly albeit a few corrections here and there. The code ran in O(n) with no space so i thought i did good. Question was find if one string is one edit distance away from the other string. This is the same as minimum edit distance question but with a twist. In this case you just want to know if its one edit away or not. The interviewer asked me if there was anything i could improve in the code, at that moment i did not think there could be any improvement other than some validation checks/readability of code. After the call i realized there was a small 5 line solution to this involving recursion but alas.

Contacted by recruiter via LinkedIn. Phone interview set up one week after contact. Interviewer contacts you on day of interview and send you a link for an online document editor. Interview lasted 45 mins. The interviewer started off by asking me what my most interesting project is that I have worked on. This took less than 5 mins. Then the interviewer gives you the rest of the time to solve a programming problem. The last 5 mins or the remaining time you can ask the interviewer questions. The question was fair.

Recruiter contacted on LinkedIn. Set up phone screen for a few days later, which consisted of basic behavioral questions and some technical questions (basically questions passed to the recruiters by engineering to weed out super weak candidates). Then a technical phone screen with an engineer. First a basic coding question. Second question was a weird one. It was basically a language specific question related to how to modify the default behavior of a certain class. I spent the rest and a long portion of the interview trying to understand what exactly needed to be done and couldn't come up with a solution at all. Then I asked the interviewer how what he was asking could be achieved and he told me about a similar class that would provide that capability. Since I had no idea about that class (and there's really no reason for anyone to know it off top of their heads), I wasted a lot of time trying to solve something that I could have never solved. This was akin to a trick question and obviously very flawed to ask to a software engineer to assess any analytical skills whatsoever. Then chit chatted with the engineer about Facebook but it was obvious that neither side wanted to engage in anymore conversation. Got a rejection email from the recruiter I believe a couple days later.

It seems that they just interview with people without giving them offer. I had a perfect day at my on-site interview. I heard a few others were like me as well. None of us got an offer. In my case, two of the interviewers were really surprised with my answers and I finished 15 minutes before the time goes up and we chat the rest of the time.

I was approached by a recruiter and asked to have a chat after which they promptly set up an interview without even asking me if I wanted to go ahead. Quite aggressive. I then had a remote coding interview with someone from the US office who didn't really bother telling me where they were located. He had a heavy south Indian accent that I could barely understand and seemed more interested in talking about himself and his job at Facebook than asking about my current role. He was unable to explain the problem at hand well enough for me to understand and when I asked probing questions he repeated himself like a broken record. For example when he asked me the space complexity, I was working under the assumption that he wanted me to make a copy of the data structure. I work mostly with immutable data so a copy is normal. He seemed surprised at my answer and we went back and forth until I finally figured out he was expecting me to modify it in place. I later found out his English language ability was quite poor as I asked him some basic non-technical questions and he asked me what certain words meant. He also cut me off while I was trying to explain my solution to him and proceeded to give me the solution which I thought was rather unfair. I guess at that point he failed me already.

I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter, and offered an interview for a Software Engineer Internship. I had two interviews, both a combination of talking on the phone and coding on collabedit.com. The first interview took place about five days after I was first contacted about the position; the interviewer asked a few questions about projects I'd done and then started with programming questions. The second interview happened a week later, and the interviewer dove straight into coding problems. I was asked general algorithm questions, like get the n-th Fibonacci number, find the square root of a number, find the depth of a binary tree, merge two arrays, etc. Both interviewers saved time at the end for any questions I wanted to ask them.

I was hiring specifically for an iOS position. The recruiters start with Obj-C 5 multiple choice questions, which required some surprising depth. I won't get into specifics, but take time to understand memory management (even with arc), blocks, addresses and pointers. After was a phone interview which mostly involved a collaborative coding question. The questions asked here were very typical algorithmic questions, the answers usually involved a hash to cache meta values to increase performance. Protip: Be familiar with NSSet and NSOrderedSet. These data structures are more performant than NSArrays for some operations, and I found myself using them in almost every answer. Then you have an onsite visit, with 4 additional interviews: 2 coding, 1 design, and 1 "culture fit" which, for me, was really another coding interview. Your recruiter will contact during the next week or two afterwards to give you updates on your status. I believe there are three different meetings where your interviewing notes are reviewed and given consideration.

I competed in a Kaggle competition conducted by Facebook. A few weeks after the competition ended I was contacted by a recruiter and asked a few basic questions via email. About a week after that the recruiter told me I was going to be interviewed. He also included a bunch of URLs to read so I would be familiar with the Facebook interview style. The interview was setup by a coordinator. Two days later the interview took place over the phone. The interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself by discussing my favorite project. He said my resume was too extensive to discuss. I worked in Silicon Valley for 5 years and have a significant background in software engineering. There was no discussion of the Kaggle competition. He then presented a puzzle. It involved a grid with the letters X, O, and G. X were walls, O were rooms, and G were guards. I had to create an algorithm that computed the the shortest path to each room from a guard. So if it took a guard 3 steps to reach a room, and another guard 2 steps, then you would only keep the 2. The grid was variable size (N x N). The task was to design the algorithm and then code it up in a shared web page. I had about 35 minutes to complete the puzzle. I wasn't able to get it completed. The next day I thought about it while eating lunch and the best way to solve it became clear. I was definitely on the right track during the interview, but it was simply incomplete. The puzzle itself wasn't amazingly hard. It's just the time constraints. I needed another 20 minutes or so to get it done right. A few days later I was told my background was not what they were looking for. This was a really strange thing to say because my background was never discussed. There is no doubt in my mind that my background is strong enough to work at facebook. As a matter of fact, after seeing the skills of the interviewing engineer (I looked him up on LinkedIn), I feel I'm over qualified. A few observations... This was the first time I've been interviewed by someone with significantly less experience than myself. Your past experience is irrelevant. I could have helped Steve Jobs invent the iphone but if you can't solve the puzzle then you'll be passed over. While I was working on the puzzle the interviewer gave me a "tip". It turns out that the tip was incorrect. I'm 100% positive that using an efficient solution is completely incompatible with the tip he gave me. Maybe it was part of the test. If you're good at puzzles and have a solid understand of software development, but not a lot of experience, then you should go apply. My personal impression is that they're looking for younger less experienced people. My interviewer started out as an intern so that seems to be a good alternative if you're still in college.

(Front End Developer) After going to a conference, and talking with several people from Facebook who also attended, I was contacted via email to see if I was interested in doing an interview. I said yes, and got my first phone interview a few days later. In a shared code environment I needed to do a recursion assignment, and also create a polyfill. It went okay, although I wasn't happy with my performance on the polyfill. This took about 40 minutes. The more surprised I was that they asked me for a second phone interview, whereby I also had to do a recursion question. I made it harder then necessary for myself, which was unfortunate. After this I was invited to Facebook HQ, and had to do 4 interviews. Interviews were about recursion, closures, css, implementations. Unfortunately I wasn't good enough for Facebook, so that got me messed up for a month or so. I thought I did pretty good, but needed too much time to get going. The recruiters and interviewers were great. The process went really smooth, and comfortable.

Overall the process is very fast and all the interviewers are very nice. It take 3 weeks to finish all the interviews (include christmas and new year holidays). I took 1 phone screen + 2 coding + 1 system design + 1 research interview( for PHD ). All the coding questions are the common questions you could meet them easily when you read " crack the coding interview" or surf GeeksforGeeks.com, and there was no brainteaser. The system design problem is kind of hard, because there are no right or wrong answers. I think I didn't perform that well in this round, because I am not very experienced in large system design. The research interview mainly focus on my research project, and we also had a small coding part, I did well on that. Honestly, I am kind of surprise that I did not get offer from Facebook, maybe there were some requirements that I did not match.

I was first contacted by a recruiter at Facebook. She told me that my background is very impressive and asked me if I would be interested in a software engineer position. I said that I would be excited and she scheduled the next round of interview with a Facebook engineer. It wasn't an on-site interview but a phone screening interview right before one. The engineer first asked me why I would want to work at Facebook. Then we moved on to two technical questions. The first one was merging two sorted arrays (both length n) in the most efficient way when the latter of the arrays have buffer size 2n. The second question was writing a function that checks if a tree is a binary search tree. For the second question, I got the right idea of using in-order traversal to check if it is a binary search but couldn't finish the implementation on time. After the interview, I wrote it on a editor myself and was sad to find out that it was not that complex at all. Anyway I am still waiting for a reply and I hope I could proceed to on-site interview. :)

I uploaded my CV in their system and got contacted by a recruiter. In the initial phone screen we discussed my interests and strength and the recruiter got back to me about a group that sounded like a good fit. Since I was local I did the first technical interview directly on site. It took about 45min. My interviewer was not directly associated with the group that I talked about with the recruiter. But he did take my background into account when asking questions. It went pretty well and a couple of days later, they invited me back for a full day of interviews. The full day interviews were mostly general coding questions and one architecture session. Although this time, I was talking directly to the people from the group were I saw a fit with my background and interests, unfortunately the interviewers did not ask any related questions. They kept strictly to (I guess) Facebook approved coding questions. Those were very low level and I did only perform moderately well I think. The architecture session went much better and was almost related to my background. After the full day of interviews it was pretty clear that this was not a good fit. They confirmed that a couple of days later and the interview process stopped there.

This was for a position in their Infrastructure team in Cambridge MA. Recruiter contacted me in September and was very interested in my background and experience with highly scalable systems - both in Finance and Mobile phone payments. I attended some small intimate presentations they did as they were initially opening a new Boston office and wanted to grow it out. The meetings were great and I learned a lot about how they solve some of their biggest problems. I then did a screening interview on-site (because I don't do technical screens well on the phone). The question was "Given a binary tree, write code to print the tree out line by line". I did OK and got the Breadth First Search down fine, but couldn't figure out the - line-by-line part. (Turns out this is Facebook's #1 question to ask in interviews). Although my performance wasn't great they gave me a break on that and asked me back for another screening interview. This time I prepared well for another coding interview but it turned out to be a Design interview. The problem was "Imagine you have 10,000 servers and need to monitor the performance of each one, how would you do it" - naturally you need to be able to NOT take too much of the bandwidth and so you'll have to do sampling, have some history to watch for trends etc. I passed that and was very excited to be flown out to Menlo Park for the final round. I studied like CRAZY based on questions on this site and CareerCup. I took 4 weeks and studied about 15 hours per week. Turns out I focused on the wrong questions - I studied Tree, String, Array and List algorithms based on the distribution of Q&A but I was asked Binary math and heap algorithms. Here are the questions I was asked. 1) How would you implement division without +, - or multiplication (a "classic" question, but not one of the ones I would focus on). I bombed on this as I was not expecting and could not recall my binary math. I figured out the high level outline but that was all. That I was asked this in the "culture fit" interview made this doubly unexpected. 2) Given 10,000 servers containing a Billion integers each how would you find how to find the median? I knew the answer to this question (use two heaps) - not because I had focused on it, but I had found it an interesting question while studying. However he then asked "How much memory do you need?" and I didn't know how big the heaps would need to be. The real answer I was trying to get is - what is the minimum heap you need. I had a guess but I think I got this wrong. 3) Given a List structure where each node contains a Next node and optionally a pointer to another list, flatten that list e.g. L1 --> L2 --> L3 --> L7 --> L8                       |                       v                      L4 --> L5-->L6 WIll be flattened to L1 --> L2 --> L3 -->L4 -->L5-->L6-->L7-->L8 I did OK on this - getting the answer - but it appeared I took too long. The interviewer also interrupted me a lot while I was writing an initial solution and that threw me off - I like to be more iterative in my problem solving but I think he expected 100% immediate correctness. He had an observer there too and that guy looked bored out of his mind and that bugged me a little too as it wasn't clear who would be doing the judging. 4) I was also handed some hard to read Python code (I don't know Python) and asked to figure out what it does. I did OK on this - but again surprised to be handed hard-to-read code in a language I didn't know. 5) One final question "How would you implement the "ls" Unix function in your language of choice. It should take the input: >ls a/b/c/*/e/*/f/*/*/g and the output should be similar the the output given by unix." I used a tree structure to represent the file directory structure and wrote a solution from there. I did OK on this. Overall: Everyone seemed very nice - I had a nice lunch and the campus is interesting but it was clear that what I studied was not what I needed to (so lesson learned: don't just trust the distribution of questions on Glassdoor or CareerCup). I even got to walk past Zuckerberg's office (more of a conference room) and saw Sheryl Sandberg in there. One interesting thing I learned is a lot of Google people are leaving for Facebook. Also I'd say if you are over 30 (I am 41) you are a rare bird at Facebook :-) I knew based on the reactions of the interviewers that it was very probably a bust, but overall a good experience and something I will learn from. Very disappointing as I really wanted to be one of the first few Facebook engineers in the Boston area - and to work on their super high scalability issues but such is Life.

Nothing unexpected, I solved all the problems but I think I was too slow on the first one, which goes like: Given an array of numbers, they are arranged so that the a[0] is in the 1st bucket, a[1]a[2] are in the 2nd bucket, a[3]a[4]a[5] is in the 3rd bucket and so on.

Everyone was edgy when I started seeing people at Facebook, including the receptionists. Granted, job interviews tend to be critical, and we are the people who seemed to be begging for the highly-lucrative job positions. Then I saw this lady, who gave no self-introduction, no facial interaction, had only super-sharp look or pretended to be, who led me through these cold stairs, picked up a drink, and up to this tiny room, then started asking me questions. God bless her, turned out she was a software engineer, and may be the domain expert in my field. OK, so let's move on to programming, by which time I became edgy, too, knowing this lady sitting right behind me, feeling her freezing eyes examining up and down my neck, maybe my hair, too (I am a man). Did she notice my white hair as well? Anyway, the interview was quick (less than an hour), and I was let go. I knew there won't be any followup. Even if it does, am I willing to experience it again? What a fast way to ruin a day-off.

I'm a Master student at a top CS grad school. I was doing an internship in Bay area in August and I started my process just two weeks before my last day there. Therefore the whole process was pretty fast because they (and I) want to finish all interviews before I leave so that I don't need to fly all the way from the east coast. My friend helped me submit my resume. A few days later the recruiter contacted me via Email to schedule an initial HR interview. In this HR interview he told me great things about facebook and asked for my related experiences and why I would like to join facebook. He looks satisfied with my background and we moved forward to schedule a technical phone screen. The phone screen went OK. I managed to code the first question in an efficient way but failed to figure out any possible way to solve its upgraded version with more constraints. I received an email from the recruiter two days after the phone screen and was told I passed it. We scheduled an on-site interview in the same week. The onsite interview consisted of three tech interviews. Two of them focused on pure coding/algorithm questions. One of them focused on behavioral questions and a easier coding question. I did well in one pure coding and the mixed one. I did OK in the last coding one: did not finish writing my code but the major part is clear and correct. I did make some minor mistakes and corrected them after the interviewer pointed it out. Four days after my on-site interview, the recruiter asked me for two references. Two days later I received the offer.

Received message via LinkedIn for an interview, shortly after replying a quick phone call was set up to determine what my interests were and how it aligns with the work available at Facebook. After that, a phone interview is done to screen candidates, the phone interview involves actual coding done using a shared online notepad. Then an in person interview is done which consists of 4 interviews (algorithms - system design - class design/algorithms - behavioral). There is also a break where you can ask an engineer any questions regarding the company. Results come back in a week after the in person interview.

Whole process took about a month but that's because I request about 1 week of prep time for each stage of my interview. I had 3 on-site interviews in total - my screening was on-site because I live very close to HQ. I also did a 3rd round interview because my feedback for 2nd round was somewhat mixed. Overall, very pleased with the whole interview experience. The internal recruiter was very friendly and helpful in helping me prep, and also very communicative of each step and process that they're going through. Was never kept in the dark. Almost every interviewer was super friendly and knowledgeable. I had mix feelings before the interview but after the whole process, I was convinced that Facebook is a great place to work.

I got a chance of phone interview with Facebook through Interviewstreet about a year and a half ago and failed quickly, mostly because I'm not a native English speaker and I am really bad at speaking English. I keep practicing English after that, then I got another chance 2 months ago, recommended by a friend interning at Facebook. The recruiter return to me very quickly, in less than a week, but I'm very busy and not well prepared at that time, so I did the phone interview a month later. I was asked to solve an easy coding problem, I finished it very quickly but made a small mistake in analyzing the complexity. I only found that mistake after the interview. The interviewer is very experienced, I have a great time talking to him after the coding phrase. Then I got a chance to onsite. I had 3 interviews. 2 interviewers asked coding problems and 1 asked coding problems and also talked about my projects in resume. The problems are harder than the problem in phone interview. I really struggled at 1 of them. But I think I did a good job at another ones. The interviewer who talking with me about my projects is from a strong background and seems a little tough, I must say I was very nervous when talking to him, but luckily it turned out well. In overall, the recruiters and the interviewers are all very nice.

Had asked my friend to refer, within a week was contacted by recruiter and was asked for dates for telephonic screen. Provided my date preference, and within 2 days the phone screen was scheduled. Got result of phone screen next day, and was invited to Facebook HQ for a day long interview. Facebook has University Day, where they call people and conduct their interviews, also on the same day they have campus tour with tech talk. But, as I had other offer deadline, they were pretty comfortable in scheduling "one-off" interview for me, and was called on non-university day just for the interviews. Interview process was awesome. Had total of 4 rounds (1 Behavioral and 3 technical). Also after first round, I was accompanied by Facebook Engineer for lunch, and he walked me over the campus. I loved the campus and the interaction with the engineer. He almost answered all my questions and further gave me reasons about why working at Facebook was awesome. Post lunch, had 3 back to back technical interviews. All the interviewers were smart, provided enough information about the problem and also left grey areas for me to ask and figure out. For all the questions, implementation was expected. Most of the time during my interviews, I was standing and writing/discussing code on the white board. Overall the day was hectic but it is indeed great fun as I got pretty interesting problems to solve and discuss. After the interviews, I got my result after a week. Summarize: Fast and Fair Process. Great experience.

I was contacted by a recruiter for the security team through email about a few openings on the security team. I said, I would like to know more. After a number of email exchanges to set up a time, another recruiter emailed me and told me someone would call me at the scheduled time. The first recruiter mentioned that I will be using the tool on collabedit.com. So far, I was not told what position I was actually interviewing for or whether I was setting up a time for a general interview or whether they were giving me more details! I did apply to a few different roles on their site so I wasn't sure what was up. Turns out first phone call was with hiring manager and I was getting interviewed for a software engineer position. Hiring manager asked if I was told what positions were available and I said no and he was glad to explain for me. I told the manager I was hoping for a security engineering job, not software engineering. He told me I might be a better fit for a different team and he will tell the other manager I was interested and I will hear from him. I asked if there was a opening on that team and he said they are always hiring new talent. I took that as a good sign. I didn't actually get asked to code during the phone interview. I followed up with the recruiters asking where to proceed and whether I could interview with the manager on the other team and they said they will get back to me. I waited and got no emails setting up another interview. I asked what's going on and have not heard back. It's been 10 days. I guess I have been dropped? I am disappointed at the lack of communication and lack of detail from the recruiters. I guess this is common with big companies.

The FB recruiters were very on-the-ball and determined to get me to campus, and worked with me every step of the way. They flew me out, put me up in a nice hotel, and helped me know what to expect in the interviews. The process consisted of four interviews, broken up by lunch. Two "ninja" interviews (coding), one "jedi" interview (personality and values), and one systems design interview (whose cool name I forgot). The questions were tough, but fair. They definitely have a preference for code questions that combine data structures and creative thinking. My only complaint about the process was that they would spend a little too much time prior to starting the coding question asking me about my OS knowledge (I interviewed for a mobile job), and that left me pressed for time (sometimes) on the actual whiteboard coding.

After I had the technical one, they really say that you must be prepared. I did not believe that it was difficult, actually I did answer it correctly, I believe that what is trick it`s the way that you answer or how fast your get it how god it`s your code, answering it correct it`s not enough.

I had a great feeling of solid communication with recruiters. The recruiters kept me accurately informed about interview progress. In order to establish an appropriate level of compensation, they seek information about my current employment without being invasive. I have felt interview process can be described by integrity and maturity, making Facebook a great place to work. This is in stark difference with my experience I have interviewing for other companies (namely Google) where after I passed the technical interviews, the recruiters pushed for very detailed compensation information, even though they in the end failed to provide an offer, missing deadlines in communication causing me to miss a competitive exploding offer.

Since I'm local to Bay Area I had an opportunity to have 1:1 onsite screen instead of phone screen. I choose that option and we arranged the interview in a week. Onsite screen was good, the interviewer was very nice and friendly, he was very helpful during the interview and there was an impression that we wanted to see my process of thinking. Eventually I solved the problem that was average difficulty. I started with brute force and then optimized it. In 2 days I got a call from the recruiter, she told I did well and we scheduled onsite interview. There were 5 interview for onsite: whiteboard programming -> whiteboard programming -> resume discussion with coding -> architecture discussion -> whiteboard programming. The problems were average difficulty. I was kind of slow on the first and last coding, I think it was expected to solve a couple of problems instead of one. All interviewers were very friendly and helpful, at the end all of them shared that I solved the problem correctly and in an efficient way and that it was OK that we solved only one problem. I already wanted to say that regardless the result my experience was positive, but after the interview I got a pretty bad experience. I didn't have any response or feedback for 2 weeks after the interview. I expected the rejection, but the silence in the first week gave me some hope that they are thinking about me (I was slow on the interview, but I didn't fail it completely). After the first week of silence I tried to contact me recruiter and eventually I figured out that she left Facebook and didn't move my case to anyone. I tried to contact Facebook careers page on Facebook, but it was helpless, they didn't reply to me. So, I found coordinators email (who scheduled my interview) and she finally shared the decision with me.

I used leetcode and hackerrank for preparation, but some interview questions were new for me. 3SUM, Intervals intersection, palindrome, BST to linked list conversion. I would recommend to solve as much questions as you can, any slowness in your thinking is not welcomed.   Answer Question

Started with two phone screens before an on-site interview. On-site interview was 4 rounds on 1:1 or 2:1 (in the case there was a shadowing interviewer) and includes lunch. On-site interview travel arrangements and reimbursements were handled by a contracted travel agency acting on behalf of Facebook. All my interviewers were very nice and professional. You will be hard pressed to find engineers with big egos here. The recruiters I worked with, on the other hand, mostly seemed like they had their act together. I thought my interviews went well – each of my on-site interviewers complimented me on my solutions, so I was surprised when my recruiter emailed me that I did not get an offer. Something fishy is definitely going on at Facebook. I am under the impression that their HR department is not completely honest with their candidates. If you sort the interviews by date on Glassdoor, you will notice that no one recently has been getting offers. I've been told by friends (inside and outside the company) that they thought Facebook wasn't even hiring anymore until the Fall... So I was definitely surprised when I was approached with the opportunity to interview with Facebook. I am at a loss of words after receiving my rejection despite the positive feedback my interviewers provided me. This experience has definitely deterred me from considering Facebook for future employment as it feels like I was brought through the process just so HR could justify their recruiting budget despite there being no job.

I got referred by a friend. After a 1-2 weeks I was contacted by a recruiter. The first stage was composed of 2 phone interviews. This interviews are algorithm questions. The first one was about grouping anagrams the second one about range intersections. After I passed this interviews I was invited for a day of onsite interviews. There where 3 onsite interviews, one was non-technical (about my background) and the other 2 technical (mostly algorithms and coding). Between the 2 technical interview I went for a coffee brake with an employee and I had the chance to ask him more questions about his work and about Facebook in general.

I applied for the position and quickly received a response that they were interested (about 1 day). They informed me that there was first a technical interview, then if I passed that, they would schedule a second culture/fit interview. Facebook provides access to a sponsored interview prep session by Gayle McDowell (author of "Cracking the Coding Interview") which were provided on a twice-a-week basis indefinitely, in in-person and online form. From this point on it was clear that they are very interested in churning through interview candidates at a rapid pace. I scheduled an interview a week after their contact, and ran prep (LeetCode.com offers a lot of questions in the style of their whiteboard tech interview) as much as I could. There were three other candidates in the lobby at the same time as me. I can only assume that there are as many as a couple dozen interviews done daily at this rate (they were scheduled 15 minutes before me). The technical interview is scheduled for a pretty tight (not hard, but they will stop you) 45 minutes. You'll get asked some sort of non-linear algorithmic question, and you MUST FOLLOW THE INTERVIEW PREP INSTRUCTIONS PRECISELY. One of the options for blueprinting out your solution is to maybe toss some pseudocode up explaining your algorithm - I did it a little while trying to explain and got dinged for "jumped to coding right away." As far as I can tell, they go through enough candidates that they can be extremely picky with their technical selection - ace it, you're golden. One misstep and you're chopped liver.

The process was fast and challenging. Phone interview, then remote technical interview with live coding through a web code share site. After passing those rounds I was invited to onsite interview in Menlo Park. The onsite interview involved 4 different people, with a lunch break. I am in my mid 30's in age, and I must say I felt like the old guy at the club. My interviewers were all younger than me, and had a palpable air of superiority. I felt like I nailed each of the interviews, but was not extended an offer with "You struggled on one of the interviews" as the only explanation. Its hard for me shake the thought that it was more work culture than work skill that prevented me from receiving an offer. All in all, no complaints. It was a fun and challenging experience and I ended up with a better job in the long run.

Application was via an internal referral from a friend who used to work at a start-up I was at. He put me in their system and around 4 days later, a recruiter called for first contact. The recruiter was quick to assess what I have done and decide to bring me straight in for a 1h30 min interview the next week. In this session I got a quick "hi" from the recruiter and then two 30 min slots, one on architecture and design (so called pirate interview) and the other on coding (ninja). Of the 2, I stormed the coding question but met with an interviewer in the pirate side that had tailored a question from his previous experience in the area I had recently worked in and it didn't work out (mostly as I knew more about the topic and the interviewer wanted to talk about a specific trick he knew). Still, I got called back the next week for a full day. Lunch, more coding, culture interviews etc... Coding and design were knockouts again, the softer skills were less successful. I think the key here is that you need to present a confident, well rehearsed personality with answers for the usual questions (biggest mistake etc...). DO NOT talk about mistakes and then admit you don't know the root cause for them, even if they were true mysteries. Pick another example!!! The process took ~4 weeks, the end dragging out by 2 weeks as it seems they could not decide if it was a hire or not. I had multiple offers by this time and had to take one that was expiring and too good to miss. Later I found that there was no hire decision and felt ok about it - I would probably think about going back at some point, but with a stronger prep in the softer skill Q+A side.

I had interviewed for a number of positions (full time and intern) before, and was never successful until this, my final chance. Luckily, things went in my favor and I was offered a full-time position. My recruiter was quick and very responsive over email. I already had an offer with another company at the time, and thus, my recruiter was able to expedite me through the already quick interview process. I had one coding challenge to be turned in whenever it was completed, a non-technical interview over the phone, and two on-site interviews. My first on-site interview was an interview with my recruiter plus a technical interview. My second on-site was a series of four technical interviews. All in all, I was very pleased with the sincerity and speed my recruiter put in and of course, being given an offer made was the cherry on top :).

Got referred through a friend at FB. They contacted me 1-2 weeks later via email. Set up a phone chat that the recruiter initially missed, but we rescheduled. Once we had a phone conversation she said they can move really fast: ~1 week to make an offer. I went on site for a first round interview (since I'm local to the area). The interviewer was nice. She asked me to describe what I work on now. Then we jumped into two coding problems. I interpreted the problem as a Hamming Distance problem and asked if it was, she kind of shrugged it off -- I don't think she knew what Hamming Distance meant. I coded a solution on a laptop (new trial process they were doing), but it turned out we were not talking about the same problem. In retrospect, the problem she was describing was Levenshtein Distance. I had the feeling she only knew the solution to the problem because she had the answer sheet. The second problem was another classic DP problem. Finding the sum of 1's in a submatrix. I went on to describe the recurring relation for the subproblem in the linear case. She didn't want me to do that and she quickly said the solution to the 2D case was a generalization of the 1D case. Because of the novelty of the laptop in the interview and the misunderstanding of the initial problem, the recruiter fought for me to do another phone screen even though the first one didn't go that well. The second interview I opted for a phone interview. This time the interviewer seemed more knowledgable and came into FB through an acquisition. I was asked what I work on now and some hard problem I solved in the past. Again two interview questions were asked (using collabedit). The first was to list out all the paths in a binary tree which was simple. I did make some mistakes and corrected it in the code as we talked through use cases. The second problem was checking if a string was a palindrome for strings with symbols and spaces in them which again is easy. I did solve both problems, but in the beginning the interviewer stated he's looking for accuracy and performance. My tree traversal was a simple preorder traversal using recursion and the palindrome involved one loop. Apparently the second interview did not go well even though I provided correct solutions in both. I guess the interviewer was serious when he said he's looking for correctness -- I guess you need to be able to code compilable/error-free code in a text editor. The recruiter and onsite coordinator were very helpful and the interviewers were very friendly. However, the style of FB interviews seems to be that you should study and know by heart common interview puzzles/algorithms/DP problems and be able to reproduce that error free.

I was contacted by the recruiter who found me via graph search, and was asked whether I was job hunting. I chose to go onsite for the initial phone screen. The question was straightforward with emphasis on fast and accurate coding, and the interviewer was very knowledgeable. A few days after the screen the recruiter scheduled an on-site with me, and the dates were quite flexible. The on-site consisted of four interviews, 3 pure coding (of which one is about design) and 1 research interview (I guess this is for all PhD applicants). I was quite happy with the coding ones but the research one was, well, a little annoying since the interviewer seemed to be dismissive to everything. But overall, it was a nice experience, two interviews plus lunch + tour around plus two in the afternoon, and it was done! I did wait for 3 weeks till the decision was make, and during the period the HR seems to be a little nonresponsive. When I followed up what I received was something like a one line email saying "we are reviewing your case and will come back to you soon". This was a little annoying especially the feeling of being silently rejected started to grow, but I guess it is not the HR's fault anyway. In the end I was offered a job with flexible titles - software engineer or research scientist or whatever. I decided not to take the offer in the end, but the interview process was very smooth.

I was contacted on 25 February via LinkedIn following a recommendation. The position was in the Mobile Operations team. It was followed by a series of phone interviews:  - one with the technical sourcer  - one with the head of the team  - two more with some specialists in various departments Following the phone interviews, was an onsite interview in Menlo Park on 22 April. Given the 10 hrs time zone difference, they were sympathetic with the jet lag and flew me there on Saturday for the Monday interviews. The interview day had five sessions:  - one with the head of the team  - one with guys from the team (codding session)  - one with a guy from management  - two more with guys from other departments (systems and networking) With the exception of codding interview, where a second guy was there to observe, all other interviews were 1:1 I flew out on Tuesday, and on Thursday I received a call that they were happy with my performance and we can move forward.

I expected a tirade of technical questions. The unexpected part was that the interview was both ways: they interviewed me, I interviewed them. Most parts were more like brainstorming session than exams. The most difficult question was when a guy showed me a gdb stack trace of the threads within a process which hung. It was an facebook internal application, so I had no previous knowledge of that application. The question was what went wrong.

I have none, which I admitted in the pre-call survey and is obvious from my Linkedin profile. That seemed to be a big problem.

I applied online through Linkedin and got an email from a FB recruiter asking whether we can arrange sometime to talk on phone. We then had a quick talk on phone about what I was doing, what I had done related to software development, and how was an interview process with FB. Then he said he will arrange a phone interview for me. The first phone interviewer was nice and I can answer the question easily although I did not understand the question correctly. But he was very patient explaining it to me and I finally did it right. After a week I received an email from the recruiter saying that the response to the first interview was positive and they wanted to schedule another phone interview. The second phone interview was a week later with a Chinese girl who did not sound friendly or enthusiastic but with a cold voice. I felt that she did not like me and would not want me to be in FB since the beginning of the interview. This made me very nervous and confused, and I lost my confidence. Hence, even though the question was quite simple but I did not do it well. I can guess what happen next: I got a "thanks from FB" the day after.

The questions are easy and common, but I was very disappointed with the second phone interviewer. The first interviewer was very nice and supportive. The first question was to return the value of a roman number given in a string. The question for the second phone interview was to print out the paths to all leaves of a binary tree.   3 Answers

I came onsite for what was described as an hour-long introductory and technical interview. I was greeted by the recruiter and shown around the office (FB NYC), then we chatted for 10-15 minutes. Then an engineer came in and we started the technical part of the interview, which took 45+ minutes (we ran over). First he asked me about Hadoop, since I mentioned that I used it at my current job. I used hadoop for machine learning tasks, so we discussed the details of the system. The rest of the interview was coding on a whiteboard. The questions got progressively more difficult. The first was: Given two string representations of binary numbers (e.g. "1001", "10") write a function that adds them and returns the result as a string as well (e.g. "1011"). The next had several parts: (a) first, write a function to calculate the hamming distance between two binary numbers (b) write a function that takes a list of binary numbers and returns the sum of the hamming distances for each pair (c) the answer I gave for b was O(n^2), I was then tasked with finding a more efficient solution. I struggled mightily, and was eventually helped to the solution by many hints from the interviewer. After that, I had a chance to ask questions of the interviewer, and then we were done. I don't know if I've made it to the next round or not.

An internal recruiter contacted me out of the blue by Linkedin and email. We scheduled a phone call. Talked about my experience and education and then about available positions at Facebook. He then invited me to come onsite for a short screening interview first. I requested a couple of weeks to prepare for the interview. He was perfectly ok with that and even sent me some links to preparation materials. Instead of a phone screen, I had a short 1:1 interview for 45 minutes onsite. Mostly coding on whiteboard and a little time set aside for questions about the company. A week after that, four 1:1 interviews. Two coding interviews. One "manager" interview: mostly talking about past projects and future ambitions. One system design interview - you basically have to describe how you would design a given system without going into too much detail. Received a call from recruiter next day. He said that I will have to come for one more interview. So a week after I had another series of two interviews, one coding and one manager. I received an offer two days after the last interview. During the whole process, the company was very flexible about scheduling interviews. Everything happens really fast if you want it, or you can take your time to prepare. Recruiter was very nice and supportive, as were people at FB in general. Some interviewers did not talk much and some were more willing to discuss, but all were very polite. Coding questions involve basic data structures like trees, combinatorial problems and sometimes a relatively simple dynamic programming problem.

I was contacted by a recruiter about a possible position. While I was not immediately looking, I was intrigued enough to continue with the process. I had a quick phone call with my recruiter to go over my background and experience. She concluded the phone call by determining my availability for a technical phone screen and followed up with some research materials to better prepare for the phone screen. The technical phone screen was set up using collabedit as the platform for sharing code between myself and the interviewer. I was asked a few simple technical questions, and a few harder programming problems dealing with algorithms and data structures. The interviewer was patient and helpful. The recruiter emailed me the same evening to let me know that I would not be moving further in the process, as my initial hesitations on the early data structure questions signalled poor understanding of basic concepts.

You are given a string with each english character translated to its alphabetical position (e.g., the string "ABC" --> "123"). Provide a function that, when provided the string as an argument, will return the maximum number of strings the encoded string could represent (for example, "123" could represent "ABC", "LC", or "AW").   2 Answers

Had brief phone conversation with interviewer initially, who scheduled a technical interview with an engineer working at Facebook HQ. The second technical interview was fairly relaxed, I was asked to solve two problems using collabedit.com, firstly, finding all the anagrams in an array of strings, secondly, finding the number of ways a given score could be reached for a game with 3 different ways of scoring (e.g. 3, 5 and 10 points). After the phone interview I was offered an onsite interview in at Menlo Park (travel expenses paid for). The interview day involved 4 back to back interviews with different engineers. The questions varied in complexity and required answers to be given on a white board. Those I can remember was implementing combinations(n, k), printing a binary tree L-R, and implementing a comparator function to sort files based on a certain naming convention. I found it difficult to make any personal connections with my interviewers, they all seemed rushed and uninterested in striking up conversation - it was not an enjoyable experience. Indeed, my first interviewer was clearly more interested in what he was working on as he arrived ~20minutes late.

Providing an algorithm for combinations(n, k), not because of it's complexity, just because it took my the majority of the interview to understand that this was the problem I was solving - it was not made very clear at all.   3 Answers

Had an HR phone call that was mostly basic questions about previous experience, and why I feel I would be a good fit at Facebook. At the end of the call, we set up an on-site technical interview. Had to postpone it a while, but they were very helpful with rescheduling whenever was convenient for me. The technical interview went well, getting a tour of the facility before sitting down with an engineer. The interview lasted around an hour. I was asked a question about checking for palindromes, and a question about graph traversal. Ran into some trouble with the graph traversal, which I eventually described to the interviewer correctly, but didn't have enough time to write it on the whiteboard. I think that's the reason I was told to get more experience and reapply in a few months.

A recruiter has contacted me through linked-in, asked whether I'll be interested to work for them, then had a talk about why would I like to work for them and I replied: that I would like to work with the best engineers. Afterward I had a phone interview with some engineer, asked me to write binary search, when I finished, he asked me to write binary search on a shifted array (10 20 1 2 3 4). Wrote that and then asked me to find the offset (2) in log n. I guess I did that ok and then I was invited to onsite interview.

All interviewers are very kind. It doesn't matter to make small mistakes during interview, interviewers are willing to give some hints to help you correct it. It is always good not to stuck at some point. I got my first interview from TopCoder, that was a in person interview, one algorithm question in 3 different difficulty levels. I waited for 2 months to get my second interview, it was a 45-min phone interview, 2 algorithm questions. It took about 30 mins to finish the coding phase, then I asked some questions about FB culture and backend engineering team. Then the Christmas came, I got feedback of 2nd interview in early January, which is positive, so they decided to flew me to Menlo Park for onsite interview. The process was quick, they pay for the flight and hotel. There were 5 rounds of onsite interviews: - 2 coding interviews, both were testing how quick and accurate interviewee can solve the problem. Problem is not very difficult, some can be found at glassdoor here. - 1 backend system design, interview asked me to explain one of the backend systems I designed. During the interview, he raised a lot of questions about the system, mostly about scalability, reliability and performance. - 1 client side system design, asked to design a client side component. - 1 half-behavior and half-coding interview It was pleasant experience to interview with Facebook:-)

Phone: 3 rounds On-site: several rounds Culture: profession Problems are neither hard nor tricky. The biggest challenge is Offensive Chinese Interviewer. If they show disregard of your question about the interview problem, don't be frustrated, keep asking what you want to know. If you give up asking, you may lose some important information that you should check with them at first. And when they are picky about your code, or when they indicate that there are bugs in your code, check it carefully, fix as much as you can. And then try to let them discuss the remaining bugs, even if you can't find any more, and no matter how dictatorial they are. Don't end up arguing with them on whether it's really a bug.

Within 2 weeks I was informed that I was approved for an onsite interview in Palo Alto HQ. There I had 4 consecutive interviews (Ninja, Pirate, Jedi, Ninja). Ninja interviews require coding in board practice - quite difficult since if you answer correctly in one of them they ask something else. Jedi was related to my PhD. Pirate was the most difficult one as there were no right/wrong answer and questions were related to database design and overall Facebook feature design. The interviewers were very friendly and helpful. In overall, a great experience!

Recruiter reached out on LinkedIn, wanting to set up time to chat. Responded with a few suggestions and then heard nothing & had emails bounce back. Finally about a month later she responds and we connect. I'm in Seattle and after we talk, we schedule a single interview on site in Seattle. Initial confirmation was for an interview in Menlo Park, so had to have another go around with the recruiters. Got it scheduled for Seattle and I came in, interview went well. I heard back later that week about going to an on-site loop. I had to reach out to get the confirmation of on-site loop. On-site was pleasant and the interviewers asked some good questions. After the loop, it took them a couple of weeks to get back to me with a no decision. I don't mind the no decision from the loop, but this whole process shouldn't take three months and recruiter juggling. Doesn't seem too organised behind the scenes for recruiting. After the whole process I left feeling disrespected.

Initial phone screen from Human Resources. He followed up after an application 5 years ago or so. He did a quick phone screen and forwarded an overwhelming number of resources to help with the interview process. This included live meetings with Gayle Laakmann McDowell with help on technical interviews. I've never been more prepared by a recruiter and probably never will be again. Ironically, this is one of the cases where I needed it the least. It really just wasn't as technically challenging as interviews at Google or Microsoft. He then followed up and was super flexible on the phone screen which I opted to do in person. It's on the candidates schedule and terms. Very accommodating. During the in-person initial screen, the recruiter again offered tons of preparation and "pep talk." He did say not to rush and to take my time, which is definitely a tendency of mine. Don't listen to that advice, though. My adherence to this advice was ultimately cited as the reason for my rejection (my slow deliberation was interpreted as "struggling"). But otherwise, it was extremely helpful and really great. The interviewer I was scheduled with was out sick so I got another guy. It was the least adversarial interview of the Google/MS/Amazon style I've ever done. He was helpful and supportive. Very laid back (he was wearing sweat pants and a T-shirt) which really helped. I really took my time and avoided going into rush-panic like I do, and was only able to get through one question in the allotted time. I answered it and came up with the solution on my first try (very long and deliberate first try), which even my interviewer said he couldn't do during his interview. But at the end of the day, I was rejected anyway. It showed that it's important not to obsess over the technical preparation. The guy who interviewed me probably was less prepared technically when he interviewed, but he probably did a better job on the soft skills. And he got the job. I worked through on the technical front with no issue, but probably spoke without a sense of confidence and made bad jokes while slowly deliberating through the problem.

Submitted resume online. I think it said there were so many people who apply that I could a multi-hour programming challenge online and if it was successful I'd get a phone screen call. Reviewing the sample problem, it might have been an NP-Hard problem or at least one that would require several hundred lines of mind-breaking code. I program all day for a living and even off hours for other projects. Resumes should qualify one for a phone screen. I submitted just that and got a canned rejection email a couple days later, presumably for not doing the quiz.

I had one phone interview, before I was invited to on-site interview on their new office in Menlo Park. They paid for all the expenses incurred during the trip (hotel, transportation, food, and any other non-personal expenses) The on-site event lasted from 9 am to 4 pm. It started with a breakfast on one of their micro kitchen located on every floor of their building, and soon after the breakfast every candidate was taken to a room where they took three 45-minutes interview with Facebook engineers. One was behavioral, and 2 were technical. In a behavioral interview, interviewer will look at your resume and ask you couple of questions related to it, so make sure you are able to talk about whatever you put on your resume. Two technical interview is mainly coding on a whiteboard. They will ask some basic question like "why did you choose Facebook" at the very beginning, but the majority of your time there will be spent coding on a whiteboard. After the interviews, candidates are taken to a lunch on one of the cafeteria on their campus. I really loved the food there, and they have lot of different choices (Italian, Chinese, grills, ...). After lunch there was 45-minute tour around the Facebook campus. The event concluded with two tech talks (one backend and one frontend) and Q&A session Overall it was a great experience.

Nothing exciting here, phone screen and than invite for onsite interview. Most coding questions you can probably get out of the Programming Interviews Exposed books. Really UN-impressed with any real creativity there. There was an architecture question during the on site which was fun and interesting, but all the coding questions were a waste of time, especially when the person interviewing did not even know the answer to his own question.

All the coding question can be found in programming interviews exposed books and websites, they are language agnostic, which is nice. ! of the interviewers not only wanted a correct answer, but *his* answer which was actually largely inefficient, but at least he knew the answer on that one...

I submitted my resume online and a recruiter got back to me about 6 months later. We set up a phone interview and the guy who interviewed me seemed like he wasn't very interested and certainly wasn't very engaging. He asked me to print all the subsets of a set, but I did it in a way that he didn't think was very good or optimized, so I didn't get past that interview.

Facebook hires software engineers from all around the world. One can apply in their website . Sometimes they invite people for interview too. First phase is the phone interview phase. Normally 2-3 phone interviews take place, where the interviewee is asked to code in a shared document. Some other questions are also asked. If pleased from the performance, facebook will call the applicant for an onsite interview.

A recruiter contacted me after a mutual friend gave them my resume. They were aware that I had a pending offer that I had to make a decision on, and were very good about moving the process along as quickly as possible. I lived nearby, so I did two on-site interviews initially. After completely bombing one of them but doing well on the other I was brought in a little bit later for the full interview. I had about 5 people interview me. Afterwards they were still unsure so I had a couple phone interviews/conversations. The recruiter did a great job of keeping me up-to-date about what was happening, was very honest with me, and was able to rush to get me an offer (which was especially nice because it was almost Christmas at the time)

Many of the interviews focus on coding exercises. It can be very hard to write code on a whiteboard with someone watching you. People are right about it being a good idea to practice writing on a whiteboard on your own first.   Answer Question

Submitted resume online. I think it said there were so many people who apply that I could a multi-hour programming challenge online and if it was successful I'd get a phone screen call. Reviewing the sample problem, it might have been an NP-Hard problem or at least one that would require several hundred lines of mind-breaking code. I program all day for a living and even off hours for other projects. Resumes should qualify one for a phone screen. I submitted just that and got a canned rejection email a couple days later, presumably for not doing the quiz. A couple weeks later I was contacted by a FB recruiter. We spoke approximate 30 minutes and emphasis was placed on how fun a place it is to work. They do a single 45-minute in person technical interview, and if that goes well they do 4, 45-min technical interviews in a single visit. The single 45-min session started with about 3 minutes of initial talk about my resume and what I work on now. I don't get the sense they cared at all about experience or what I was or have worked on. After that charade was done, we jumped right to the whiteboard. Two programming questions were asked. The first was an array reordering one that was almost trivially easy but I worked through it cleanly. He seemed quite happy with that. The second was significantly harder than the first, a complex array algorithm. I worked my way through it on the board but my solution was non-ideal in time complexity after analysis. He suggested we rework it. While I was able to and understood the logic, I relied on his feedback a bit much to come to the final solution in the last minutes. Got rejection email the next morning from recruiter. Apparently others in their interview pool for the position had got a more optimal answer faster.

I was cold-called by a recruiter and offered a technical interview. I scheduled the interview, but in the meantime, I received an offer from another company, and canceled the interview. Later, I decided to re-apply for the same position and the process continued where it was left. I was interviewed by phone and asked to complete a coding assignment. As I discovered later, this assignment appears here as one of the questions. Later, I was notified I passed the phone screening and was invited for an on-site interview. There was a total of 4 interviews, including three coding interviews. Even though most of the questions appeared on this site, I did not do very well in the coding part, thus, as expected, did not receive the offer. Throughout the entire process, the hiring staff was extremely helpful and provided lots of information regarding the position, and the interviewing process itself. The recruiter also organized a phone call with on of the engineers to help me learn more about the position I was applying for. While at Menlo Park, I was accompanied by the recruiter and she showed me all around the campus.

After I solved a puzzle through InterviewStreet.com, a recruiter contacted me by e-mail and we set up an introductory phone call (15 min). She seemed really nice, she asked me to evaluate my knowledge on several technologies and sublects like C++, Perl, Algorithms/Data Structures, .NET Framework etc. She immediately told me that she was going to schedule a technical interview with an engineer. The engineer called me several days later and asked me to solve together an algorithmic problem via a workspace sharing website. We could both write code simultaneously and see each other's work. The question wasn't hard and although I had a pretty good idea how to solve the task, I wasn't very smooth and made several mistakes. Maybe because it was my first technical interview ever. Bottom line, I liked their attitude and they did a good job. It was my fault that I didn't go to a second interview and I've learnt my lessons. It was a very good experience.

Since I had some industry experience, after my phone screens, I had the full onsite interview loop. All interviews involve some coding, but they vary in how much: - 2 ninja (coding) interviews. These are garden-variety programming interviews and can be prepped pretty much the same way you'd prep for Google or any other major software company. - 1 jedi (engineering fit) interview. The jedi is designed to assess whether you'll thrive in Facebook's engineering team. You'll talk about problems you've worked through in the past, engineering decisions you've made, and so forth. You'll likely do some coding, too. - 1 pirate (engineering design) interview. If you're in the product-engineering bucket, you'll probably be asked to design a user-facing product; the interview will range from actual coding to high-level design considerations. New-grad hires (people without significant industry experience) will generally not have pirates.

Got contacted through college. 2 technical phone rounds..both coding. questions were moderate to tough then onsite

The initial question (writing a function to calculate a square root) ended up being the most difficult because it threw me off. I knew there was a good iterative method for doing so, but could not recall Newton's method in the moment, and I sadly let this nagging thought get in the way of my ability to work through the problem. My failure to perform well on that question set a negative tone for the rest of the interview, since each interviewer after the first can see notes from the previous interviewers.   9 Answers

I was contacted by a recruiting agency for software engineering position at Facebook, and after I told them I was willing to apply, my resume was forwarded to Facebook's recruiter. Next day, I got an email from the FB recruiter with a link to an online coding test on interviewstreet. This test was for one hour duration, designed to test coding skills of the interviewer. It was a string parsing problem and code could be written in any language and we'd just need to submit the output on a given input set. I got an email later from the Facebook people that I passed that test and would need to do a phone interview. My phone interview was scheduled in a week.               An engineer called me up for the phone interview and asked about my work projects. I explained to him briefly and also got to know a little about his work at Facebook. He then followed onto the technical interviewing part and posed a problem for me. We were working on a shared document for this part. This was a problem about the classic binary search tree data structure, like an RB Tree. I coded a simple solution and I was asked to analyse its runtime complexity. I analysed the complexity and was able to put it in Big O notation. He was satisfied with that solution and then moved onto talking about his work, what Facebook is expecting from the candidates and such. The conversation quickly ended after that . A couple weeks later, their recruiter informed me that I passed the phone interview and would be scheduled personal interviews.             About a month after my phone interview, it was the day for the personal interviews and I was flown into their interviewing location. I had two technical interviews that day and another general, informal get-to-know-you-and-your-work type of interview. For technical interviews, code was to be written on a whiteboard. In one of the technical interviews, I was told to come up with an algorithm for a variation of the classic knapsack problem. This could be solved with a dynamic programming and I coded the same on the whiteboard. It's important to explain how the solution was arrived at. After coding it up, I was asked to analyse its complexity. I'd written a recursive solution and I could only write a recurrence relation for the complexity function, not a closed form. I also told him that an interative solution is also possible and wrote it out too. Being an iterative code, with a simple nested loop, it was also easy to analyse its complexity. The interviewer was actually ok with the recurrence relation for the complexity and didn't bug me on an exact form. He seemed satisfied with my solution and then we moved onto general topics. Interview was quickly over after that.             For the second technical interview, I was asked a problem on balanced binary search trees. I'd previously implemented an RB Tree and that experience helped me very much for this interview. Without this experience, I couldn't have solved that problem and would've been rejected. I was asked the classic interview problem on sorted-but-rotated array. I knew the solution for this one and it involved binary search. I wrote the solution for this one and the interview was quickly over after that.             I was told to provide 3 personal references on that day and left for home. About 2 weeks later, I was informed that there would be another technical interview. In this interview, I was asked to implement a simple regex parser. Conceptually, some what simpler than the other interviews, but getting the implementation correct was tricky for this one. I got it right and he was satisfied with the code. I was also then asked about the runtime complexity for the solution. I left the interview confidently.             A week later, I was offered the job. Generally speaking, good programming skills help a lot in getting this job. On top of that, I'd suggest reading the CS algorithms textbook by Cormen. Writing good code, with a clear understanding of its complexity is a must.

Hey I got contact with a recruiter, then we talked about 30 minutes. One week after I had one phone interview. He asked me two coding questions and he also wanted me to prove mathematically why my solution is right. I did the coding problems and I prove what he wanted. After a week, they invite me for onsite interview. There were 4 interview. The first was more about my research and only one coding question. The last one was high level design question and the other two were just coding. I did pretty good, and I just made one silly mistake for implementing one problem. I figured it out after 10 min, but I had the feeling that the interviewer does not like it. That was the coding question at the end of the first interview. I think that killed me and I didn't get any offer.

Got a mail from a recruiter asking me if I am interested. Then he scheduled a coding interview on Skype. They instructed me before this interview to go over all of the CS basics. I did the interview, was OK, and then I was invited to an on-site interviews day. Although I live outside of the US they had no problem flying me over, they paid for all expenses and arranged this whole thing in one week(!!). At the campus I had 4 interviews: 1 X design "high level" interview. 1 X manager interview, we talked a lot about the product(s), company's culture and my background. (And a short coding questions in the end) 2 X white board coding interviews. After the first two interviews I had lunch with this extremely nice recruiter and she also gave me a tour in the campus which was really cool. Couple of days after the on-site day I was contacted and they told me that they need to interview me some more because there was a miss match within the feedbacks I got. We set up another session of two consecutive Skype coding interviews which were really good and after couple of days I was informed that they want to send me an offer ;-) Total 7 interviews. 5 of them were coding. TIPS: * Get extremely comfortable with CS undergrad material: classic algorithms, data structures, sorting, string manipulations(!!), lists, trees, basic linear algebra, working with large data sets. Don't only read about these topics - make sure you can code it, fast and accurate!! In the Skype/Phone interviews they asked me to write the code in http://collabedit.com. [I am not allowed to disclose the specific questions... sorry] * If you are reading this review then you are on the right track - I practiced only by answering questions which were posted on this site. I first tried to solve them alone, when stuck I checked the answers section and on StackOverflow. * Make sure you are well familiar with this company and its product. It will come up in every interview and especially in the manager interview. Be ready to give great answers on "Why facebook?" - I think all 7 interviewers asked me this question and it's really important to them. * For non US residents - Make sure you arrive to the bay area couple of days before so you'll be able to rest and beat the jet-leg. I've arrived 24 hours before, couldn't sleep because of the excitement and jet-leg, I think that being really tired (especially after lunch) affected my performances. BOTTOM LINE - Challenging for a position at FB is huge and you have to invest a lot of time and effort into it. At least that was the case for me, I studied real hard and almost didn't make it.

Got the interview referred by an employee. The interview process was very impersonal, with canned e-mail responses and literally no connection between the recruiter and the applicant. The recruiter persistently ignored my questions regarding team assignments. Had only one interview, with the "collaborative" coding question asked within the first 15 seconds of picking up the phone. Poor English skills of the interviewer and unwillingness to provide any hints were extremely unexpected. Despite providing the complete theoretical solution to the problem, the interviewer toyed with me not finding a small mistake in the code. After "deciding to move forward with other candidates" the recruiter declined to provide any feedback on the application. Undeniably it's a great place to work, but the recruiting process left a bad taste in my mouth.

The recruiter called up and asked me if I was interested in the job opportunity. The process began with solving a programming problem on InterviewStreet for which I was given 90 minutes to solve. This was followed by a 60 minute telephonic interview. After clearing these two rounds, I was invited onsite and I had to go through 3 face-to-face interviews. The problems were hard algorithmic problems and you are expected to write clean code in the first go. The interviewers were really friendly and helpful. My advice would be that you have confidence in yourself and be as honest in an interview as possible. For practice, you should be well versed with standard algorithmic techniques like dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, solving linear recurrences in logarithmic time, recursion, tree traversals, etc.

You are given an integer N and an integer M. You are supposed to write a method void findBestCoinsThatMinimizeAverage(int N, int M) that prints the best collection of N coins that minimize the average number of minimum coins needed to generate values from 1 to M. So, if M = 100, and N = 4, then if we use the set {1, 5, 10, 25} to generate each value from 1 to 100, so that for each value the number of coins are minimized, i.e. 1 = 1 (1 coin), 2 = 1 + 1 (2 coins),..., 6 = 1 + 5 (2 coins), ..., 24 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (8 coins), and we take the average of these coins, we would see that the average comes out to ~5.7. But if we instead use {1, 5, 18, 25}, the average would come out to be 3.7. We are to find that set of N coins, and print them, that produce the minimum average.   8 Answers

Facebook recruiter contacted me via twitter and LinkedIn and asked if I was interested in a career opportunity in Facebook. After that the recruiter scheduled an HR interview with himself via Skype. This was just a standard HR interview. The recruiter was very friendly. The whole call was very relaxed. After that he decided to schedule a phone screen with an engineer from California. This consisted of just a few HR questions eg. "What would you change in Facebook?". After that he gave an assignment on collabedit.

First round interview at the facebook seattle office. The question was related to string parsing : basically given a set of key value pairs in some format, to print them according to another format. I did not understand the specifications clearly and probably should have spent more time doing that. Instead, I went through many iterations with the interviewer pointing out specific mistakes each time. My advice : the question may be very different from what you think it probably is, so spend enough time making sure you get it. Also, in case of this problem, it was algorithmically very simple, but you are bound to miss some cases and make certain mistakes. So, when you see a simple problem, try to look at the problem and your solution carefully for possible gotchas.

Got an email from Facebook that it sees my resume and wants to give me an interview. But first get a call from the recruiter to discuss about my intention. The phone lasted like 10~15 mins, just asking about my previous experience, graduation date, and my team choice. Then the 1st phone interview was scheduled. It is probably one of the hardest, thinking that they want to cut down as many people as possible. After that was the 2nd, then on-site. On-site, I met like 6 others Google Interns, and then we had a tour of the office, lunch, then 3 consecutive interviews. Then I got the offer like 3 days later (cuz I told them I had other deadlines, so they made it fast). They had a talk with one of my professor, who I wrote as the reference.

Facebook came to our campus and I was pre-selected for an interview for their summer internships. They told me that it was going to be a 45 minutes long interview. The interviewer demonstrated very odd social skills, contrary to the fact that he worked for the major social networking company. Interviewer didn't even introduce himself, or look at my resume or ask how I am going. They instantly put me on the white board and asked me to write some code. I politely asked him whether he even looked at my resume. He mentioned that he didn't look at it, and he rather want me to focus on writing code on the board. At that point, I was a bit ticked off. So, I told him that I didn't want to work for a company where people are treated as coders, and not humans. Then, I just walked out on him. The entire experience lasted for 5 minutes. When I emailed the HR person expressing my disappointment, she defended the interviewer by saying that they were interviewing a lot of people and that's why they didn't have time to chit-chat with the interviewees.

Apr 25, 2011
---------------
The phone interview was brief and mechanical. The interviewer seemed clearly unprepared, inexperienced, and uninterested, as if it was an unwanted interruption to their day. The interviewer had no knowledge of my previous conversations with the company or why exactly he was interviewing me. I was clearly passed his way expressly for the purpose of evaluating my technical ability. The interviewer asked two coding questions, using an online collaborative editor to view my progress. After the problem was sufficiently answered, the interviewer quickly ended the conversation. As it has been described to me, Facebook has "streamlined" the hiring process in order to be able to evaluate candidates very quickly. From my experience, this came off as unorganized and unprofessional. My final impression was that the interviewer did not thoroughly evaluated me as a candidate, but sufficed that I could answer 2 standard interview questions quickly and with explanation. Compared to other companies I interviewed with during the same period, this interview was not rigorous enough to really determine quality.

A recruiter found my resume online and emailed me asking if I would be interested in opportunities with Facebook. We then spoke on the phone and she scheduled my first technical interview. Throughout the process the HR person was very friendly and helpful. The technical interviews were conducted using Skype and collabedit.com. They consisted mostly of algorithms and data structures questions, and a few questions about projects I had mentioned on my resume. The first two interviewers were very friendly and positive, and I felt the interviews went very well, having answered all the questions correctly. The last interview was conducted by a grumpy engineer with a thick accent who was running 15 minutes late and sounded like he didn't want to be there. Unfortunately this put me off quite a bit, and I did not perform very well in that interview, 3 days later I heard back from HR that they wouldn't be proceeding with on-site interviews in Palo Alto.

I'm not sure whether he was assessing my skills at finding a solution given a weird constraint (e.g., use sqrt()), or if there is an obvious solution that I missed.

Recruiter contacted me, reasonably quickly [within a week] after applying online and was generally very helpful. But the first interviewer started phone interview around 10 minutes late [in the end ending up kicked out of conf. room] and asked two very simple questions. One of the questions was given 2 arrays of size n and 2n containing n elements only, both sorted in ascending order, How will you merge, first array with second [which has size 2n] into second array in ascending order. I just used merge sort merge step and wrote java like psuedo code in collabedit. I tried out my code later and it worked fine with no changes [except that I used .length() instead of .length for array length]. But he didn't provide any feedback on what he was looking for. It was correct and complexity was the best possible. One thing I can think of later was I didn't add any method level comments [although I had comments in body] as it was pseudo code. Maybe he was looking for it [pure guess - as I don't know what he wanted]. I left with impression of having done the interview very well [I have worked in the best of companies and got interviewed and interview for those companies] and most of the time you know when you blew it. But I was surprised to get the rejection, 2 days later! Particularly given that question was too easy! Now I am left pondering over what was it? I consider interviews where the perception of interviewer and interviewee differs wildly in terms of performance as bad interviews with negative experience associated with it, as the interviewer didn't communicate his intention with the interviewee properly. If he was not looking for correctness and perf. [objectively defined as mentioned above], What was it?

He asked a few follow-up questions afterwords about my code (which I think he made up on the spot). I answered and we agreed on the answers. Next, he presented a scenario that we formed a web startup featuring that code at its core. So then we discussed how to use more memory and less CPU, and how to scale up the company. At the end I asked him his thought about fb and what he did before working there. The experience was very fun.

I was contacted by a recruiter out of the blue based on my web presence. I went through three phone interviews, then an on-site. Every single interview was exactly the same format: the interviewer gives me two or three programming problems and asked me to solve them in my language of choice in front of him on a whiteboard (or virtual whiteboard). No behavioral interview, and the only contact I had with the HR chicks was "OMG you should work here."

I was first called by a FB recruiter and we chatted about 15 min about my general background information. I then was followed up with a phone interview with a FB engineer. He seems to be an experienced engineer. He started with a common background question like challenge of current project. Then, he asked me to design the Facebook Credit system. I proceeded with talking about I would started with designing the backend of the system, for example a ER diagram that would outline the relationship between existing user information and the new information related to the FB Credit system. I was a little nervous at the beginning, but the interviewer jumped in and gave me some help. He then asked me how would the total credit points of a user be calculated based on my design. For that question, I answered how the data is delivered to user from end to end in a multi-tiered web application. Next is the programing question (write a function to convert an ASCII representation of a positive integer to it's numeric value). I had a subtle bug in my code, but in general I got it right. I coded in PHP, the interviewer is satisfied with it since FB uses lots of PHP. The last 5 min was for me to ask him some questions. The interviewer was very professional and helpful during the interview. He was able to follow my thoughts and provide hints.

First I had a phone interview. The question was fairly straight-forward (multiply two very large numbers given as Strings) and the interviewer wasn't looking for any tricks or anything like that to solve. Like others have mentioned, quick clean code seems to be the key. Unfortunately, the interviewer had a very thick East Asian accent and talking over the phone just made things worse. I had to ask him to repeat quite a few times. It was probably me but at times I couldn't even tell when he'd asked a question because of the inflection! It must've gone well enough though because I got an on-site call. The on-site was two interviews of 45 min each. In the first one, I took a bit of a hit because a) I couldn't see the solution right away b) it took me a while to get up to speed and code the thing - I did manage to finish it though and it seemed (relatively) bug-free. Again, as lots of people have mentioned, the interviewer seemed quite young, just a year or so out of school and he didn't offer much in terms of feedback - positive or negative - as the interview progressed. Once he'd given me the question and given me the hint that got me started, he was busy with his iPhone, rarely looking up. That kinda sucked. The second interviewer was much nicer - probably one of the best ones I've interviewed with - lots of feedback, lots of encouragement, was accepting of different trains of thought and non-standard answers. Seemed like a really nice guy too. Overall, it seems to be the case with Facebook that a) Your interview really depends on who you get b) They seem to value quick-clean-bug free-optimized code at the first try more than anything else c) Questions are of average to above-average difficulty (if you've prepared!)

My resume was submitted by an employee. I got a call from recruiter next day, she was nice and explained me the process, then scheduled me for phone interview within same week. She was nice enough to provide some interview tips, so I had chance to review some topics. I think fb recruiters are totally on your side. The phone interviewer was a very nice guy, he was definitely not a recent graduate like some other poster complained, he talked about the pre-internet boom days, so I think he has least 15 years experience. The phone screen took 45 mins. First 10-15 mins, he asked about my background and why it's a good match for the position, why I want to work in FB. Then I was asked to coding question to "find minimum depth of a binary search tree". It was not a hard question, any average coder could do it within 15 mins. I wrote the code with no hint or help from him. During the coding, he was mostly quite, at one point, he pointed out a possible bug which I fixed instantly. At the end, I was trying to optimize the code, he said the code would work, no need to optimize it further. Then he let me ask questions about FB about 15 mins. After the interview, I compiled the code and it really worked, didn't even have a single compile error. Next day, I received a rejection letter from the recruiter with no details. So trick is, writing the code is not enough, but your code must be very close the most optimized version known and you should be able to write 'close to perfect' code in minimum time. I googled for similar algorithms and found out my solution was well above the average, but not the best one. I guess they expect you to write something very close to best available code possible can be written, so they single out best coders. So 'move fast, break things'..

I had on campus interviews in the spring and then decided to interview for full time in the fall. I had three interviews - the first went very well, the second was terrible, the third was alright. The terrible interviewer asked some basic technical questions involving writing code on the board. As I thought out loud, I asked the interviewer clarification questions and then ultimately asked whether I should start writing code on the board. The interviewer either did not respond to my questions or mumbled off a few incomprehensible words. I started writing code and as soon as I stepped back from the board, the interviewer pointed out my mistake without giving me a chance to assess the code myself. He did this an another two times for the subsequent questions. Overall, the questions were not difficult at all. It seems that Facebook wants to make sure that you code frequently enough that you do not make any errors on your first hack at a problem. This seems to fit the "go fast and break things" motto. Although things didn't work out for me, I got an offer from Google, so I guess that's not a bad second choice.

The rumours about the hiring process being haphazard are true. First a manager phone screened me and asked me to come to Palo Alto. Next the recruiter told me I stll need to go through a phone screen. If the disconnect stopped there it would have been OK. I did not expect to get invited to Palo Alto without a tech screen. Here's the kicker. I am a senior engineer in my present job. The person who phone screened me was a fresh college hire and had spent about 1 month working at facebook. Facebook was that person's first job. I am not saying a new hire cannot be smarter than a senior person, but it is reasonable to think that it would be a good practice at a big company to allow new hires especially fresh out of school to settle down, understand the needs of the company and then start interviewing people.

1st round HR screening 2nd round coding online 3rd round coding online The 1st and 2nd rounds are great. However, the 3rd one is terrible since the guy on the other end of phone is keeping silent and provided little feedback during the whole process. Basically I think they are more interested in find the people who can do tricky programs in a very short period of time while keeping solid code and clean coding style. The HR is very fast in turnaround, though the final decision is kind of be kept back for a while, but if you ask they will let you know. Anyway, this is the first company I got interview so maybe it is just too difficult for a rookie interviewee. BTW, I though Chinese engineers tend to be more silent in interview, which is sort of "rude" to the interviewee since there is not much conversation in such case.

I was contacted by the Facebook recruiter saying I need to solve one of the puzzle from the Facebook puzzles to start the interview process. I had solved one problem and then recruiter scheduled my phone interview. The interview was good. The guy at the other end was nice and smart. The interview last for around 1 hr. It start by asking me about myself. He asked me about my choice between three platforms (linux kernel, MySql, JAVA script). I had chosen Mysql and he asked me why did I choose MySql. Other questions are described below. I got response from the recruiter that they would like to keep me on hold, as they are finding difficulty in judging with large number of candidates. I answered all questions correctly (I feel) except my written code (took around 10 to 15 mins) for the problem had one bug which he had noticed correctly and told me to resolve it. After resolving it he gave me the green signal. One of the big problem (I guess one of the main factor in the interview) I faced that as I am OK with English, I was finding difficulty in understanding his accent. So many times the interviewer had to repeat his questions. Lastly he asked me if I have any questions for them. I asked one question. This is how end my phone interview with Facebook.

An HR contacted me and said I should complete one of their three hardest puzzles. The puzzle was interesting, but the fact that I spent 2.5 days to do that (1 day was spent on submitting it in a correct way so that the puzzle robot accepts it), and it won't help when interviewing anywhere else, annoyed me. I then had a phone interview. The guy was very clever, which was nice. The questions were: what is the most exciting project you had, and white a function to multiply two arbitrarily large integers. I spent quite a while writing a recursive solution for the problem, made some mistakes during that, but fixed those purely by myself. The interviewer did not provide any feedback during the process when I described my "way of thinking" and the programming, so I even had to ask whether he was on the line. With phone interview, not feedback is a bit too harsh, imho. Then I was asked to write an iterative solution, and I completed it as well. I did not write the solutions easily, and my way of explaining was not perfectly clear and great, but I solved what I was asked. Then the HR contacted me saying they won't consider me anymore this year. I politely asked for feedback, but got the answer that there is nothing to share. Quite surprising for a social-oriented company.

I was referred to Facebook by a friend and the hiring recruiter emailed me the next day. He asked for the resume saying that he will send it over to the hiring manager. Next day, the recruiter asked for the convenient days and time to call, and called me the following day. He explained the hiring process, asked me about myself and what I did/do. Then, a week later, I had technical phone interview with a FB employee. We had a session in Google Docs set up. She first asked me about myself a little and asked one technical question. I had to write C/C++ code in Google Docs while explaining what I do on the phone. It was quite hard actually. Not even the question itself but the whole experience, you feel bad if you make a typo (and i did many silly typos that I usually do not make when writing code), because she can see your typing in real time. Also, you cannot debug or anything.. In the end, to understand my idea of a solution, she gave me an example input and asked to traverse it using my code. After getting an idea she said, ok, almost correct, you could find a bug in 10 mins, ya, but we gotta end now. Next day the original recruiter emailed me saying that they wouldn't take me. It seems they needed the correct solution and code to be done on the fly in 25 mins.

Was originally contact by a recruiter over LinkedIn. I had a phone interview, followed by a visit to a Facebook recruiting event where I met with an engineer in-person, followed by another phone screen, followed by an on-site in Palo Alto with 4 members of the engineering staff. The whole process seemed somewhat disorganized, I was informed after my recruiting event visit that I would be getting an on-site as the next step, but was informed a couple of days later that I'd have to do another phone screen first. The questions in the screens and the onsite seemed reasonable enough. I'll admit to having somewhat of an off-day at the on-site. I completely fumbled the "are there any bugs in your code" question with at least one of the interviewers; I said there wasn't, but there was a pretty obvious bug once he described the failure mode to me. There was a scheduling mix-up with at least one of my interviewers, which caused my time with him to be cut short. I'm sure that didn't help with him getting a good feel for me for the sake of his interview feedback. The culture seems a bit more corporatey than the recruiting buzz might put forward; it seems geared toward people who want to have one foot in the startup pond while having the other firmly planted on the dry land of large, relatively safe organization. There are a lot of small teams, and the reflection I got is that there is a non-negligible amount of bureaucracy weighing on the organization. I guess when you get to 1000 people, that will happen. The office space is a mostly open floor plan, and the gear the developers are provided to work on is really good stuff. But that's an initial impression, and things are not always as they appear. So yeah, weirdness in the interview scheduling and such dragged down my impression, but I'd probably give the dice another roll if the chance comes up again. If nothing else, it will allow me a second glimpse to either bolster or contradict my first impressions.

I was contacted via email by HR saying that my friend had recommended I be interviewed for a spot at the company. I was pretty surprised by this, but have found that this is how Facebook often goes about doing things. We scheduled an interview for a few days later, which I thought was going to be a technical interview. When I got on the phone with the interview he asked me about what I've been working on recently, and so I got into this whole thing about my research project which I probably took a good 10 - 15 minutes describing. He basically just verbally nodded through the whole thing. He then asked me about what positions I was interested in interviewing for at Facebook. In my push to prepare for what I was expecting to be a technical interview, I somehow neglected to actually figure out what specifically I could work on at Facebook. I mentioned doing something with the large data sets they work on, since my research focused somewhat loosely on large-scale data analysis. Should have prepped for that one, but no problem. He then told me that he'd be happy to set me up for a phone interview with an engineer as soon as possible and I was like "whaa?! I thought you were one!". Not actually, but I did say that I'd be happy to interview with an engineer and so he got that set up for me.

facebook is an unprofessional company to interview with. The first phone interviewer only wanted some insider information regarding my company (which I didn't give to him). The second interviewer could not get the interviewing tool working! He wasted 1/2 hour of my time before calling and telling me he would like to reschedule. So I patiently rescheduled with HR for the next day. The 2nd interviewer now calls 20 minutes late. Is fairly rude and capricious. Says that he is in a hurry. Did not explain his problem correctly. When I explained my solution, quickly tacked on some additional requirements and then said my solution did not work. The interview only lasted about 15 minutes. Said that he worked on consistency problems at facebook. Everybody knows how horrible the facebook newsfeed consistency is. Total time wasted with these people = 4hours (over two weeks, not including recruiter time). Compensation offered for my time; none. Conclusion: run as fast as you can from this company.

I heard back from them about a week later and we setup a time for an on-site interview. I was alotted $1000USD for travel expenses to travel from Toronto, ON to Palo Alto, CA. The on-site interview lasted 4 hours and was split up into 1 hour interviews with a different engineer. The questions were mostly abstract, and language independent. Content of the questions varied from riddles to database design. My impression of the first three engineers was good, they seemed like nice guys, and knowledgeable. The last interviewer came off as pretentious, I felt as though he wanted me to fail -- just my opinion! Overall, the office culture seemed relaxed and the problems they are solving there are interesting ones. I'd recommend interviewing with them if only for the chance to visit Palo Alto!

Pretty superficial compared to the in-depth interviews I've had for many other employees in Silicon Valley and otherwise in high tech. I was astonished that they seemed nonplussed at the prospect of somebody weaving back and forth between (very senior) individual contributor and (technical) manager -- that cluelessness is something I expect from big old ossified companies, but this "weaving" pattern is perfectly normal and expected in young dynamic up-and-coming hi-tech outfits (hey, I've been doing this for decades;-).

Stage one was a phone screen, clearly intended to give them a feel for whether I can think on my feet or not. Then, a full day of interviews in the office - mixture of coding and culture fit interviews, where the culture fit interviews were done by underrepresented groups, and the coding interviews were mixed. Again, very clear that the goal was to get me a chance to sink or swim on my own merits. Coding interviews were split between coding on laptop and coding on whiteboard, to give me a chance to come back if I can't code on a whiteboard. That came back unsure, so I came in for one last interview session.

I was referred internally by my friend. I attended a phone interview after contacted by a recruiter. The interviewer actually told me directly on the phone that I should work more on my coding skill. So I was totally surprised to learn that the interviewer's feedback was positive and they'll continue with my application. All the following process was mostly coordinated by another recruiter, who is very responsive and I greatly appreciate his help. The on-site interview had 2 sessions before noon and 3 after, with the last one and lunch time not being evaluated. Originally I was told that I'll hear the result the next week, but instead I waited 2 weeks and learned that I didn't make it. The recruiter did emphasize that I was really close, and also let me know that it was the system design question that I didn't perform well. (There was yet another coding question that I found difficult, but the recruiter told me that they had no problem with my coding skill.)

First recruiter phone screen, then 45 minutes on-site technical interview followed by a 4 rounds technical interview loop. Interview process is good however it appears the interviewers are more focused on coding fast and coding without bugs. It is a test for memorization skills instead of actual algorithms knowledge and the candidate's ability to solve a real engineering problem. They are looking for canned solution, any out-of-box idea would get rejected. I'd say the facebook hiring criteria would prefer younger coders who are just out of college and who had been exercised simple algorithms codings for a year or so. Leetcode.com is its bible. Experienced engineer may not be favored if you don't have time to sweep the coding exercises.

One phone interview and one onsite interview. The process is relatively quick because I contact the HR directly. The interviewer and the HR are very very nice. Talking to them really makes me feel relaxed. I had the onsite interview at Facebook New York office. The working environment there is just amazing. I think if you enjoy the job as a software engineer, you would love that.

No very difficult questions. Just take it easy and enjoy the process. Almost all of the question are from the &lt;Cracking the Coding Interview&gt;. A quick response and emphasize on the issue of efficiency are important. I think Facebook love to ask questions about the tree structure and some practical questions because they are realistic problems. When you prepare and practice, do remember that efficiency is a really significant issue, much more important than simply giving an answer. And I would like recommend another book &lt;Programming pearls&gt;. Maybe the book is not a hard one to read, but the thought of the author, why the author wants to improve some algorithm and how he solves problems are really fantastic. The questions are from realistic problems and the book is really worth reading several times. It benefits me a lot.   Answer Question

I originally had applied to Facebook through their online portal. After a few weeks of no response I reached out to a recruiter at a Facebook event and she saw my resume. After I convinced her I was ready for the interviews, she set up my first phone interview of three total. After the interviewer gave a fairly long intro of his bg I was asked several behavioral questions. I was asked why I picked Facebook, what is my field of interest, and had to discuss a project of mine. At this point we reached the technical portion. He asked me the following question. Q: Given a number n, return a number formed from the same digits of n that is the number right before n. Example: Given 1342, you must return the number 1324. After this we spent a fairly lengthy period of time talking about coding habits, facebook, push cycles, and other production related questions I asked. At the end of this interview I felt terrible, I thought I'd completely failed it because I only answered one question. I couldn't sleep all night, but then the next day itself I received an e-mail saying I'd passed to the second round. They asked if I wanted some time to brush up before going in for my final interview. I asked for a week and prepared. My second interviewer called from a conference room due to which the sound quality was a bit off. We talked and she asked me a few similar questions to the first interviewer delving into my background, projects, and my schoolwork. Eventually we began the coding questions. The first question was the LCA problem with no parent pointers. I immediately started analyzing the problem's base cases for recursion, determined an optimum algorithm that covered all cases, and wrote the solution before coding. After explaining it and running through test examples I began coding the solution. After coding it, I spent a fair amount of time proving my code works with the interviewer before she accepted it worked. We had approximately 15 minutes left at this point so he said we can begin another problem before ending five minutes early, a statement I was confused by. The second question was to design a method to store really large numbers that exceed 64 bits, and then to write a method that can add two of these numbers. I began coding and had just finished the code when he said we ran out of time. He asked me about any questions I had and seemed to be in a hurry so I asked a few questions then the interview ended. At this point I waited for approximately 2 weeks after I sent two emails to my recruiter asking about the feedback from the interview. I was asked to do a third phone interview with a product team member as the engineers had noted I was interested in product development. I was a bit confused but happy overall to still be in the running. We scheduled it for a few days later and I went in relaxed. In the interview, I was asked why Facebook, a project of mine, which field I'm interested in and why, followed by a technical question. I coded in Java although she mentioned she hadn't used Java in a while so she didn't care as much about the syntax. The first question was the classic anagram question. I described two solutions, one using a HashTable and one relying on bucketsort. I coded both methods and did a complexity analysis before she expanded the problem. Now rather than checking if two strings were anagrams, I had to group a list of strings by anagram grouping. I described how we could use a Hashtable to store the sorted string as a key, and have the original string be contained in the value as a linked lists. After writing the algorithm out in pseudocode she said I didn't have to implement it in Java and that she believed it would work. After a complexity analysis she then asked me this mix of behavioral technical questions. What would you do if Mark Zuckerberg came to your desk and told you Facebook was slow and he wanted you to fix it. She then asked me to describe a product I'd design if I worked at Facebook. I mentioned several related to data analytical tools for Facebook users on their own data. I mentioned the benefit to users before naming another idea involving querying newsfeed for posts related to the topics described in the query. After this she asked me if I had any questions for her before she told me that my recruiter would get back to me within a week. I waited three days before I received an e-mail from my recruiter that she wanted to talk for a few minutes if I had time. I immediately responded I was free and she called me shortly after. She then gave me my offer for an internship in Menlo Park, described the components of the compensation, and explained briefly the process involved with the internship. Afterwards she asked me if I had any questions. I was too blown away so I just said I'd email her once I think of questions before we ended the call. I accepted that night.

Since I had another pending offer deadline before the on-site interview date, they rescheduled the on-site interview via phone (which is a pity). The on campus interview (45min) only had one question on whiteboard I made it smoothly. The phone interview, however had two questions in 45min. I spent 30 mins on the first one and didn't finished the second question, but the interviewer was super nice! He gave me some hints on the second one and discussed with me about the question when I knew I already ran out of time. He even answered my question patiently. I had a pending offer deadline and requested a quick feedback, and two days later I got the offer! That was awesome since I didn't expect to get it at first.

(I guess because I live in Belgium) - Favorite coding langs ? - How many hours do you code besides school projects ? 1 week after the phone call they setup a technical phone interview with a coding question. No response as it is weekend, and the interview was on Friday.

A professor wants to see if two students have cheated when writing a paper. Design a function : hasCheated(String s1,String s2, int N) that evaluates to true if two strings have a common substring of length N. Additional question after implementation. Assume you don't have the possibility of using String.contains() and String.substring(). How would you implement this. Questions about complexity of my solution. Overall a very friendly interviewer, was saying "Good" the entire time, but no idea if he wanted to keep me focused or if it was really good.   3 Answers

2 phone interviews.Interviewers were asking standard questions very similar to those that can be found here or on careercup (traversing trees/graphs, woking with matrices and vectors, picking up numbers with certain properties in sorted/unsorted arrays). At first interview I solved 3 out 3 problems and on the second one fully and second sub optimally + I was almost done with the optimal solution, but I've run out of time. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to get an offer.

There was a lecture on our university that was given by Facebook employees and they gave us a link to apply online on the Facebook site. I applied and the recruiter contacted me in less than a week. She was super friendly and flexible so we arranged a Skype interview on a date that worked for me. On the first interview the interviewer was late for about half an hour, he apologized and I said it was okay and it went fine. I was asked 2 questions about data structures, one of which was from the book I was preparing from. The next day I got an e-mail from the recruiter that they wanted another interview and once again they worked around my schedule. All the way through my recruiter was very fast when it comes to sending e-mails. The second interview went a bit worse than the first one, far from a perfect interview. I got two questions again and the interviewer didn't give me plenty of time to think. For example, the interviewer pointed to wrong things in my code before I said I was done with it. After I said I was done with the code, I was asked whether I can make it better, so I did make it better, but I was given a hint before I started coding even though I would probably come to that conclusion, but I guess that the interviewer wanted the interview to move a little faster than I was most comfortable. Anyways, I coded the better solution. Then I was said that there exists a better solution and I didn't know how to make it even better, so I said that I would have to think about it, but we were right about to be out of time so we stopped. I was also said that I can expect to hear from my recruiter within a week. My recruiter, who was very fast in answering up to this point, didn't contact me at all. I was a bit dissappointed because I thought I didn't pass the interview. I waited for a little more than a week and then sent an e-mail to ask whether there are any news. The next day she responded and apologized for not contacting me (she said there were some issues with the recruiting tool). And later they told me that I passed through. So I guess I wouldn't get it if I didn't ping my recruiter, so don't be afraid to do it, I was weighing to send an e-mail or not :)

The interview questions were okay, all the topics were what I expected and what they said they were looking for, data structures and a bit of algorithms.   Answer Question

A friend from Facebook referred me. A recruiter called me few days later. She sent me an email, asking general questions like: "When do you graduate? How often do you code? Strongest programming languages?" After answering the email, I had an initial chat with her over the phone, where she asked general questions like: "What office do you prefer? Would you consider a position in UK after the internship?" One week later I had the first technical interview. The interview started with 5 minutes of questions about my work, then we jumped into one coding interview question. The question was simple: Write a function which given two binary numbers as strings returns the sum of them in binary. 5 minutes for my questions at the end. Few hours after the interview, I got an email from the recruiter saying that the feedback is very good and they would like to schedule the final interview. The last interview was easier than the first one: "Given a list of strings, return a list of lists, where each list consists of words that are anagrams." Example: Given ["cab", "cz", "abc", "bca", "zc"] the output should be: [ [ "abc", "bca", "cab"] , [ "zc", cz"]]. I managed to finish this question quite fast (after only 15 min). The interviewer wanted to finish the interview after 15 minutes, but I insisted to get another question. The next question I've got was even easier: "Write a function which returns the nth number of Fibonacci". When I've seen the question I jumped straight away implementing it (took me like 2 minutes), then we compared the iterative method with the recursive one. After the interview, I got an email from the recruiter saying that my coding skills are very good, but the interviewer complained about the fact that I was a bit careless when answering the questions, and that I didn't explained him the Fibo solution before writing code. They wanted to schedule another interview. One week later I had the last interview, which was some kind of giving me another chance, because they usually have only 2 interviews. The last interview was much more difficult than the other two. The first question was: "Write a recursive function which given a string, prints all the subsets of it." After solving this question, he added one constraint. Now what if you want only unique solutions? This was quite hard, and I only managed to solve it after he gave me one important hint. The second day I received a standard rejection email.

Given a string write a function which prints all the subsets of the string. Now make the function to return only unique solutions. For example if they give you "abc" you print out a ab abc ac b bc c Now for the unique solution constraint, if they give you "aba" the output should be: a ab aba b   7 Answers

I was referred by an employee and received an email reply within 48 hours (Oct 28). My recruiter set up a phone screen within the week. It was a 45 minute technical interview that I found a solution for. Again, within 48 hours I received an email saying that I passed. Facebook gave me an option of three "University day" on-site interview dates, each about a week apart from each other. I chose the last date, Dec 3rd, almost a month later. Facebook will cover all of your traveling fees, so no worries about the cost of flying across the country. The internship on-sites start with one 45-minute interview, then lunch (good food!), then a tour, then a quick presentation about why Facebook employees love working at FB, then an open Q&A with new FB employees. By chance, my recruiter was hosting the interview group, so I got a super early-bird heads up that I received an offer before I even left FB headquarters! From what I gather by talking to other interviewees, you might have to wait 3 or 4 days to hear back from your recruiter. Good luck, everyone!

Facebook loves graph theory and tree questions. Study up on these for sure. I feel like my questions were of average difficulty, not hard by any means. Some of the other interviewees I talked to received recycled questions that I've seen on this site and on careercup.   1 Answer

The first one was an on-campus interview. It was 45 minutes long and consisted of 2 coding questions.

The question was to multiply two numbers that are represented in string. My advice is that don't panic when you are given a hard question. I did not finish my last question and luckily still got the offer. Just try your best to show them how you approach the problem and be passionate and confidant!

The process started out with a pre-screening test which was coding based. There was one question to be done in 60 minutes. The question was fairly simple for me and I completed it quickly. Then, I was called for the onsite interviews a week later. The interview was supposed to last for 45 minutes. Now, in my interview, I was first asked about the best experience I have had in my last two years. Then, the interviewer quickly moved on to the coding questions. There were two questions for which I had to explain my solution and then code it on the whit board. I was able to both the questions, but I guess the interviewer might not have liked the way I had explained my approach as I was not called for the next interview. The interviewer was not very vocal and did not really participate in the discussion where you explain the approach. That is why it becomes difficult to detect if the interviewer is understanding your words or not. Anyways, it was a some experience.

Facebook recruiters come to my university each year to recruit talent. In November, a recruiter reached out to me to see if I would be interested in an opportunity at Facebook during the summer. I hadn't been looking for internships at the time, nor did I apply to Facebook, so I was pretty surprised by the message. After I told them I would be interested, I had a phone screening with a recruiter, during which they asked me pretty basic technical questions (a question about Java key words, can't remember the rest). I did well enough to pass this stage and then I was given the option to go for a phone interview, or an on campus interview. My recruiter told me that candidates usually do better during on campus interviews, so I was scheduled for one a month later. My on campus interview went really well, and the interviewer was really nice and easy to talk to. I got a message from my recruiter that night that I would have the opportunity to fly out to their main office for a final round interview. I attended their "Intern Day", which was a day filled with one 45-minute interview, an informational session about the internship program, a tour of the office, talks given by current Facebook engineers, and also lunch in their cafeteria. My interview could have been better- I got the answer, but I stumbled a bit along the way. I recognized my errors pretty quickly and was able to correct myself throughout the process, so I think this was a plus. I was contacted the week after my interview about different internship positions available at Facebook. After considering the options, I was given an offer for the SDE intern position about a week after that. The entire process spanned 5 months, but it was totally worth it!

It was 45 minutes, consists of general questions and 1 coding question. I didn't do well for the coding one. I couldn't solve the problem and tried so many ways to solve it. Finally, the interviewer gave me the approach to solve it, and let me code. I didn't code well though, so many mistakes. After the interview, I had a tour around the campus. I still shocked from the interview and thought I wouldn't pass.. and I didn't :) However, I really had a great time at Facebook HQ. I thought about the question again and it wasn't hard..

I walked the interviewer through the solution and he asked questions on edge case scenarios. Overall, the interview went ok, but I did not receive a next round call. This was probably because my solution was not optimal and upto their expectations. It was a good experience and I learnt a lot from it

First they organized a test of online puzzle. After completing it, they contacted after about 1-2 weeks and set up the interview time. The first interview was over phone and asked me about basic things like what I've worked on and which technologies I am familiar with. The second interview (also over phone) was a technical interview and I was given a problem to solve where the interviewer could also see me coding (via a screen sharing site). And as I was coding, he was asking me why I was doing them and suggested me to improve the algorithm.

I had two technical interviews, both on the phone since I live in Europe and all of Facebook's development is done in the U.S. They talk to you on the phone while asking questions, then you code in an online text editor of which they can see the results live as well. They're very reasonable during these interviews: when you didn't quite get a question, they'll happily explain it better, if your answer is good but not quite there, they'll point you in the direction they want to hear more details about, and so on.

I applied for the position when Facebook was interviewing on campus. Emailed my resume on the deadline, called up for interview within 5 days. After passing the first interview, I was informed that evening that I had a second interview the next day. After that, it was about a week or so before I heard back, and since I was a graduate student the third and last stage was to match me with a particular group. Within a few days of the matching process (done via phone) I received my offer letter. The two on-campus interviews consisted of writing down actual code (in my case, I used Java) and they were fairly basic and specific data structures related questions.

Facebook came to my university's career fair and I briefly talked to one of their engineers and gave the recruiter my resume. They emailed me back within 1.5 weeks and invited me to do a 45 minute interview 1 week later on my school's campus. During the 45 minute on-campus interview, the interviewer asked me to briefly introduce myself and summarize a few highlights on my resume. Then he gave me a few simple coding questions to do on the whiteboard. He allowed me to use any language that I wanted to use. Also, the night before the campus interviews, Facebook hosted a reception at a pizza place so that all the interviewees could casually meet our interviewers beforehand. No need to dress up for a Facebook interview--they're very casual. My interview was wearing a t-shit.

You have a single branch of a GIT or SVN repository. At some commit number G, the code in the repo worked (G = good commit). At a later commit number B, you noticed that the code was broken (B = bad). The code may have become broken anytime at or before B, but after G. B was just the first time that you noticed the code was broken. Both G and B are positive integers and G < B. You have access to a function.......bool isCommitGood(integer)......... that takes a commit number and tells you whether the code at that commit worked or was broken. Write code to find the most recent working commit (i.e., the number/index of the last good commit before the code became broken).   1 Answer You have an unsorted array of integers and a function........string getCategory(integer)........which deterministically returns 1 of three possible strings: "low", "medium", or "high", depending on the input integer. You need to output an array with all the "low" numbers at the bottom, all the "medium" numbers in the middle, and all the "high" numbers at the top. This is basically a partial sort. Within each category, the order of the numbers does not matter...For example, you might be give the array [5,7,2,9,1,14,12,10,5,3]. For input integers 1 - 3, getCategory(integer) returns "low", for 4 - 10 it returns "medium," and for 11 - 15 it returns "high". You could output an array (or modify the given array) that looks like this: [3,1,2,5,5,9,7,10,14,12]   1 Answer

There's nothing much to say about my interview process that's not already been said. I was referred by an employee and they responded pretty promptly to my application. There were two rounds of phone interviews spaced a couple of weeks apart, and then a full day of on-site interviews. Facebook is becoming a big company, and this is apparent in some of their turn-around times. There used to be complete radio silence for a week or so before some news came in sporadically. I think did pretty well in the coding and other parts. The one part I knew I was weak in, and which the interview process corroborated, was the system design part. There are not too many resources to help prepare you for this, and this cannot be built up through preparation alone, you need to have been working in a lot of software projects, or better still, worked as an engineer to answer these questions well. I was sent in for a follow-up design interview on the phone after the on-site, and ultimately rejected. I don't have much to say. The coding questions are very standard. They're probably easier than they were earlier, and this again reflects the size of the company. The engineers I talked to seemed happy at Facebook, although the hacker culture, the quick and dirty way of doing things and the general focus around pushing stuff to production turned me off a little. I know that this is Facebook's culture beforehand, but coming face to face with it left a bad after-taste in my mouth. Or maybe the grapes are sour.

The first questions were a little general,tell me about yourself kind of thing.previous experience and the challenges faced. There were 2 coding problems, one based on recursion,factorial kind of thing... And afterwards ,a question on merging two sorted arrays in linear time.My approach solved the problem in quadratic time and was asked to improve it to the best I can. At first I couldn't really see how;but the interviewer was really nice.He gave me hints to start with. At first I stumbled because I could not immediately get the whole idea.I kept on saying stuff without changing the code until I said the right thing and he agreed with me afterwards. I am waiting to hear the outcome of the interview which I have hope I passed and will get the chance to work with such wonderful and humble people.I really liked the guy,so down to earth...I feel like crying right now...

I applied online and was approached by the HR to initiate the interview process. My next interview was a technical one and I had hoped to clear it, but failed. The interviewer was helpful, but failed to see my perspective. I initially approached to solve the problem in O(N) time using an algorithm that I thought I knew. But I got confused and 15 mins in the interview, I asked whether I could use another approach. This is when I got shaky. I proposed a solution in O(N^2) time. He asked to make it faster and using Hash Tables, I improved the time to O(N) and space to O(N). And with a hint from the interviewer, I ended up solving in O(N) time with constant space (and then started writing the code). During the whole interview session, I accidentally kept confusing things (for instance calling a node,a root node because I was thinking in terms of sub-trees and recursively). This generally doesn't happen even when working under stress. I felt the interviewer grossly underestimated me, but I blame myself for that. If there is anything I would different then it would be to use the easiest approach to solution the question first. A positive start boosts up the confidence. Make sure to explain CLEARLY (using the correct terminology) how to tackle the problem. One more thing: embrace the fact that there is always a possibility of getting rejected. So, blurt out whatever you solution you think should work. There is not enough time to derive your approach. And be confident. Sometimes you can trick the interviewer into believing that you know exactly what to do, even when you don't (if you are close enough).

After applying online I got a very casual recruiting email a few weeks later reaching out about a specific product engineering position, in fact I wasn't sure if it was real (wasn't addressed to me), but I looked up the recruiter and she was listed on linked in as employee of Facebook, so I responded. It took a while to decide if she could continue as my recruiter or if I needed to go through a university specific recruiter, but once my first phone interview was setup the process moved quite quickly. The first phone interview was a 45 minute coding interview. Pretty standard for the big companies. I completed 2 questions. What was the most unique about this process, is the feedback from that initial interview was shared with me by the recruiter - giving me that so I can improve on it for the in person interview, which I really think is a great reflection of Facebook's open culture. Facebook, like Google, generally doesn't hire for specific teams, however, they took the time to find a project at Facebook I would find especially interesting and fill my in person interview with people on that team so I could ask questions about it. Facebook has three types of interviews which they call Ninja, Pirate and Jedi (because they are the best kind of dorks). I had two Ninja Interviews and one Jedi. Ninja is typical coding interview where they ask 1-2 coding questions. The Jedi interview is culture fit where they ask you how you work on team, but you will also spend half the time coding. I think Pirate are focused on distributed systems type questions, but I was informed that they often skip these questions for New Grads without any explicit experience, because it's something most people learn from working in the industry and they don't get strong data from those interviews. It's also worth noting that during my job search I had coding interviews with 18 people and 17 of them were men, Facebook is the one company where I had a technical interview with a woman, although it was still the Jedi interview. I applied to Google at the same time as Facebook and their process moved a little faster, so I got an offer from Google the day before I went in for an in person interview, thankfully I had enough time to decide for Facebook to get their counter offer in, and the recruiter's care in setting me up with that team was a big part in what made me decide to go with Facebook.

I initially applied in early November, 2013. I got a reply from one of the recruiters about a week later. After talking to the recruiter on the phone and emailing back and forth for a while, she realized that I was still in school (graduating mid 2014) and transferred me to another recruiter.. or rather a bunch of different recruiters who couldn't seem to figure out who I should be talking to. Eventually we got everything sorted out (now in January 2014) and I did two phone interviews. They both went well and shortly after, they arranged for me to fly to Seattle for a "university day". They put me up in a nice hotel across the street from the office and, of course, paid for meals and everything. They even set up direct deposit for the reimbursement, which was nice. The day of the interviews, I arrived in the morning and signed in and then I was met by a couple recruiters. There were also a few intern candidates but no other full time candidates. I had 3 interviews that were all fairly interesting. The first one was mostly a fit interview, the second was the in depth coding interview and the third was a combination of talking about experience and doing some coding. After the interviews, we did a tour of the office and then we met with a bunch of engineers for a Q&A session. This was a really great way to learn about the company and see how everything works there. It seemed like a really great place to work with lots of really smart engineers though I was mildly concerned about the apparent lack of organization. In the afternoon, one of the recruiters took us downtown for Seattle's "Underground Tour" which was really neat and later they took us out to a super fancy Italian restaurant which was excellent. Overall, it was a really great day. About a week later, I got an email from one of the recruiters asking for references and my transcript. I have an almost perfect transcript (straight A's) and I was certain that my references would say nice things about me so I felt that I had the job in the bag at this point. One of my references forwarded me the questionnaire they sent him. It was just generic questions like "How did you know him?", "Would you hire him again?", "What were his strongest/weakest attributes?" This reference included his answers which were all extremely positive, re-enforcing the idea in my mind that I was going to get an offer. A week or so after this, I heard from the recruiter again asking me to do more phone interviews. Supposedly, it was "great news that [they] still [wanted] to move forward with [me]" but I didn't really take it that way. Frankly, I find it rude and unprofessional that they would waste the time of my references if they weren't already prepared to make an offer. However, I, of course, went through with the phone interviews, uncertain what they could possibly learn about me that they hadn't already figured out in the first five interviews. The first of the second round of phone interviews (6th interview overall) went very poorly as the interviewer has a very strong accent and a horrible phone line (lots of static). I could barely understand what he was asking which made it very difficult. I contacted the recruiter about this and she seemed at least somewhat understanding. She then booked another phone interview which went quite well, as far as I could tell. Finally, the week after this (now into March), I got a rejection letter which I was rather dumbfounded by. I can't for the life of me figure out where I went wrong or why they would bother contacting references if they weren't prepared to make an offer.

I was selected for an on-campus screening interview. The interview was pretty easy compared to other companies. After the initial ice breakers, was asked an open ended question related to area of my interest followed by 2 coding questions to be solved on a paper. Basic questions testing if you can write code and know data structures. Was informed in a couple of hours that I am selected for on-site interview. The process to select the dates and flights, hotels was smooth. There were about 30-40 other new grad candidates and intern on the day of interview. Every new grad had just 3 coding interviews one of which was behavioral interview for checking if the candidate would be a good fit. The other two were ninja coding interviews. I had two coding questions in the behavioral round which I answered well. Two question in the first ninja round which were pretty wasy and I coded pretty quickly but messed up a basic thing in the first question. Had time for only one question in the second ninja round. This was the only tougher question in the interviews and I got the ideal answer in the end but didn't have time to finish the coding part. I think the basic mistake in the second interview and the third interview messed up my chances. I feel the company puts importance on how fast you come up with perfect answer. That's the questions are simple. So you are expected to be quick thinking and are expected to not mess up something so simple. There was lunch, awesome tour of campus and two tech talk after the interviews. This was one of the best interview days I had this season (I have had 4 on-site interview till now). No all day long torture of interviews and pretty awesome talks and tour giving an inside view of the company. Would interview again if given a chance!

Initially contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. After this contact I had an introductory phone interview followed by another phone interview with some basic technical questions (what does final in front of a class mean etc). Then I was set a 90 minute programming test on interviewstreet. Upon passing the test I had a 45 minute phone interview with coding on collabedit. The recruiter was very helpful but the final interviewer did not speak very good english and despite being told I would be contacted via telephone, I was emailed 10 minutes after the interview was supposed to start requesting a skype address for the call. Unfortunately I struggled to remember how to implement the Indian Power algorithm for the interview question so was rejected a few days after.

A friend who's an engineer there passed my resume along. Had two phone interviews which I found quite difficult. They both had me code in collabedit.org, and the second also actually ran my code on codepad.org - that was a surprise! I did not do perfectly on the phone interview questions, but still got through. They brought me on-site for an interview day which included a tour, lunch, a talk, and four 1:1 interviews. One-half of the first interview included some questions about leadership, teamwork etc., and the rest were all technical. One of the interviewers seemed to be in a grumpy mood, but that's the luck of the draw. The whiteboard coding questions were not too bad and I think I got them all, though with some silly mistakes along the way. I'd agree with the previous reviewer who said their questions are not as difficult as Google's- though perhaps they therefore have higher expectations as to how quickly/flawlessly you solve them. On my way out they gave me a goodie bag with some swag. Oh, and at one point I saw Zuckerberg milling about. Got an email a week or so later- I would not be winning the Facebook IPO lottery!

I've applied from facebook.com/careers and 3 weeks later a recruiter sent an email that they were interested in to make an interview. They were very kind and interested. I got a detailed instruction about the process. Also they gave me some blog posts or other links that I've already found at my company research. They said that the phone interview worth to prepare and I may take time to study. I wanted 2 weeks to get ready and they accepted that. Than, someone else (another recruiter) got in touch to create the schedule of phone interview. After creating appointment, before that 2 weeks, they called me to just talk. It took about 5 mins. I asked some questions about the company and recruitment process. After two weeks I got a call and that was an engineer. He asked me some questions about my background. After answers, I've signed in to an online editor to write some code in shared session. They asked two algorithm questions and I thought I was not so bad. After these questions, he asked to me that do I have any question about company or technology. I've asked something to just ask. He answered them very kindly and detailed. After 45 mins at talk, he said that's time to go. About 5 hours later, I got an email from the first recruiter that I'm not suitable. Also the recruiter has added as a contact on linkedin. That was completely sign of they are nice and they want über people.

I applied through my school's career services and was contacted by a recruiter a few weeks later. She set up a phone interview that she did herself. It was a technical interview, asking questions about data structures, algorithms, and runtime analysis. It wasn't hard. The questions were mostly about trees, hash tables, and a couple sort algorithms. She was nice at first when she asked me about my experience in the field (school projects and internship experiences) but she caught me off guard when asking the technical questions and I asked for a minute to think about the answer. Even though she said yes, a moment later she'd say "Would you like me to move on to the next question?" as if I didn't know the answer, but I did. So I'd try to explain to her what I thought at that moment and if I missed anything in my explanation, even the smallest thing, she'd cut me off to point that out and moved on to the next question. Fortunately, I did quite well. By the end of the week she emailed me that I'm through to the next round and that another recruiter would contact me with the details. After a few weeks, I didn't hear back from them so I emailed her. Apparently she had been snatched up from Facebook to a new startup company and left her files to other recruiters who didn't have time to go through all. It took me about a month (through the help of friends who also interviewed with Facebook and school's career services) to finally get ahold of a Facebook recruiter. She apologized and set me up with another interview right away. A software engineer called me a few days later and we used a website that let me code and he'd be able to see it. The second interview was just one coding problem (make sure you're fast and code bug-free programs!) and then we spent about 15-20 minutes talking about Facebook itself. I thought I did well and hit it off with the interviewer. But a few days later I got an email saying that I'm not through.

I had one on campus interview, a follow up phone interview and then an on-site interview at their HQ in downtown Palo Alto. HR did a fantastic job with coordinating the interview day but the engineers that interviewed me were on their cell phones and did not seem interested in conducting a comprehensive interview. Every interviewer started off with "Why Facebook?" and asked an algorithm and design question. I realized later that almost all the programming questions I was asked were pulled DIRECTLY from "Programming Interviews Exposed". From the book: The design questions were centered around processing large amounts of data, caching, time complexity, etc.

One phone interview and one onsite interview. The process is relatively quick because I contact the HR directly. The interviewer and the HR are very very nice. Talking to them really makes me feel relaxed. I had the onsite interview at Facebook New York office. The working environment there is just amazing. I think if you enjoy the job as a software engineer, you would love that.

No very difficult questions. Just take it easy and enjoy the process. Almost all of the question are from the &lt;Cracking the Coding Interview&gt;. A quick response and emphasize on the issue of efficiency are important. I think Facebook love to ask questions about the tree structure and some practical questions because they are realistic problems. When you prepare and practice, do remember that efficiency is a really significant issue, much more important than simply giving an answer. And I would like recommend another book &lt;Programming pearls&gt;. Maybe the book is not a hard one to read, but the thought of the author, why the author wants to improve some algorithm and how he solves problems are really fantastic. The questions are from realistic problems and the book is really worth reading several times. It benefits me a lot.   Answer Question

I originally had applied to Facebook through their online portal. After a few weeks of no response I reached out to a recruiter at a Facebook event and she saw my resume. After I convinced her I was ready for the interviews, she set up my first phone interview of three total. After the interviewer gave a fairly long intro of his bg I was asked several behavioral questions. I was asked why I picked Facebook, what is my field of interest, and had to discuss a project of mine. At this point we reached the technical portion. He asked me the following question. Q: Given a number n, return a number formed from the same digits of n that is the number right before n. Example: Given 1342, you must return the number 1324. After this we spent a fairly lengthy period of time talking about coding habits, facebook, push cycles, and other production related questions I asked. At the end of this interview I felt terrible, I thought I'd completely failed it because I only answered one question. I couldn't sleep all night, but then the next day itself I received an e-mail saying I'd passed to the second round. They asked if I wanted some time to brush up before going in for my final interview. I asked for a week and prepared. My second interviewer called from a conference room due to which the sound quality was a bit off. We talked and she asked me a few similar questions to the first interviewer delving into my background, projects, and my schoolwork. Eventually we began the coding questions. The first question was the LCA problem with no parent pointers. I immediately started analyzing the problem's base cases for recursion, determined an optimum algorithm that covered all cases, and wrote the solution before coding. After explaining it and running through test examples I began coding the solution. After coding it, I spent a fair amount of time proving my code works with the interviewer before she accepted it worked. We had approximately 15 minutes left at this point so he said we can begin another problem before ending five minutes early, a statement I was confused by. The second question was to design a method to store really large numbers that exceed 64 bits, and then to write a method that can add two of these numbers. I began coding and had just finished the code when he said we ran out of time. He asked me about any questions I had and seemed to be in a hurry so I asked a few questions then the interview ended. At this point I waited for approximately 2 weeks after I sent two emails to my recruiter asking about the feedback from the interview. I was asked to do a third phone interview with a product team member as the engineers had noted I was interested in product development. I was a bit confused but happy overall to still be in the running. We scheduled it for a few days later and I went in relaxed. In the interview, I was asked why Facebook, a project of mine, which field I'm interested in and why, followed by a technical question. I coded in Java although she mentioned she hadn't used Java in a while so she didn't care as much about the syntax. The first question was the classic anagram question. I described two solutions, one using a HashTable and one relying on bucketsort. I coded both methods and did a complexity analysis before she expanded the problem. Now rather than checking if two strings were anagrams, I had to group a list of strings by anagram grouping. I described how we could use a Hashtable to store the sorted string as a key, and have the original string be contained in the value as a linked lists. After writing the algorithm out in pseudocode she said I didn't have to implement it in Java and that she believed it would work. After a complexity analysis she then asked me this mix of behavioral technical questions. What would you do if Mark Zuckerberg came to your desk and told you Facebook was slow and he wanted you to fix it. She then asked me to describe a product I'd design if I worked at Facebook. I mentioned several related to data analytical tools for Facebook users on their own data. I mentioned the benefit to users before naming another idea involving querying newsfeed for posts related to the topics described in the query. After this she asked me if I had any questions for her before she told me that my recruiter would get back to me within a week. I waited three days before I received an e-mail from my recruiter that she wanted to talk for a few minutes if I had time. I immediately responded I was free and she called me shortly after. She then gave me my offer for an internship in Menlo Park, described the components of the compensation, and explained briefly the process involved with the internship. Afterwards she asked me if I had any questions. I was too blown away so I just said I'd email her once I think of questions before we ended the call. I accepted that night.

Reached out recruiter on campus career fair. Got campus interview and later on-site interview. Since I had another pending offer deadline before the on-site interview date, they rescheduled the on-site interview via phone (which is a pity). The on campus interview (45min) only had one question on whiteboard I made it smoothly. The phone interview, however had two questions in 45min. I spent 30 mins on the first one and didn't finished the second question, but the interviewer was super nice! He gave me some hints on the second one and discussed with me about the question when I knew I already ran out of time. He even answered my question patiently. I had a pending offer deadline and requested a quick feedback, and two days later I got the offer! That was awesome since I didn't expect to get it at first.

The interviewer was nice and got straight to the technical questions. He asked two. The first was easy, and I spent the rest of the time on the second. He gave me hints as I struggled along. I was told we would receive feedback in the next week. I got an email a week later about flying to their Menlo Park, CA HQ for an on-site interview and tours/talks. The schedule consisted of one 45 minute interview, and the rest of the day was lunch, a tour, and two tech talks. It was very relaxing! The interviewer asked me one technical question and built it up a bit, and then he asked me about the most recent bug I encountered. It took them three weeks to get back to me, which made me think I didn't get the job, but I got the offer in the end! They were really nice and really wanted to get to know you as a person, not just whether you know your algorithms. They also really cared about showing their interest in hiring you, which was a plus and not something you get at a lot of big tech companies. I had a great experience!

First the interviewer have called me on time, he introduced himself and his project which takes about 10 minutes, then he asked me why do you want to join facebook.. Then he started in the technical questions, the first questions was: he described to me a game called othelo (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) which is a 2 player board game using for example X and O, if player X placed X in an empty space _OOOX the O's between the two X's will be converted to X XOOOX ==> XXXXX this will happen on the current row, column, and the two diagonals in every directions and if the following case happened __OOX and the X player placed X in the first space X_OOX nothing occured for the two Os given a certain state of the board, location on the board, a certain piece to place on the given location update the board, and make the required validations Then I started to code the required method, then have revised it and fixed small bugs, then he told me that it seems to be working. then we turned to the second question: which is given a Collection<String> words, return a Collection<String> of anagrams found in the given collection for example "The rat fell in the tar" => returned [rat tar] Then I have discussed him in an algorithm with O(n k lg k) where n is the number of words and k is the average length of the word, then I started to code it and then he said that it seems to be working. then the interview is finished. Notes: * Try to practice a lot before the interview, by solving such problems and try to mimic the interview environment by coding in the collabedit.com text editor * Don't use Ctrl + S while coding in collabedit as it may lead to some problems. * Don't be afraid before the interview, just calm down as the interviewers are very friendly.

2 phone interviews.Interviewers were asking standard questions very similar to those that can be found here or on careercup (traversing trees/graphs, woking with matrices and vectors, picking up numbers with certain properties in sorted/unsorted arrays). At first interview I solved 3 out 3 problems and on the second one fully and second sub optimally + I was almost done with the optimal solution, but I've run out of time. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to get an offer.

There was a lecture on our university that was given by Facebook employees and they gave us a link to apply online on the Facebook site. I applied and the recruiter contacted me in less than a week. She was super friendly and flexible so we arranged a Skype interview on a date that worked for me. On the first interview the interviewer was late for about half an hour, he apologized and I said it was okay and it went fine. I was asked 2 questions about data structures, one of which was from the book I was preparing from. The next day I got an e-mail from the recruiter that they wanted another interview and once again they worked around my schedule. All the way through my recruiter was very fast when it comes to sending e-mails. The second interview went a bit worse than the first one, far from a perfect interview. I got two questions again and the interviewer didn't give me plenty of time to think. For example, the interviewer pointed to wrong things in my code before I said I was done with it. After I said I was done with the code, I was asked whether I can make it better, so I did make it better, but I was given a hint before I started coding even though I would probably come to that conclusion, but I guess that the interviewer wanted the interview to move a little faster than I was most comfortable. Anyways, I coded the better solution. Then I was said that there exists a better solution and I didn't know how to make it even better, so I said that I would have to think about it, but we were right about to be out of time so we stopped. I was also said that I can expect to hear from my recruiter within a week. My recruiter, who was very fast in answering up to this point, didn't contact me at all. I was a bit dissappointed because I thought I didn't pass the interview. I waited for a little more than a week and then sent an e-mail to ask whether there are any news. The next day she responded and apologized for not contacting me (she said there were some issues with the recruiting tool). And later they told me that I passed through. So I guess I wouldn't get it if I didn't ping my recruiter, so don't be afraid to do it, I was weighing to send an e-mail or not :)

The interview questions were okay, all the topics were what I expected and what they said they were looking for, data structures and a bit of algorithms.   Answer Question

A friend from Facebook referred me. A recruiter called me few days later. She sent me an email, asking general questions like: "When do you graduate? How often do you code? Strongest programming languages?" After answering the email, I had an initial chat with her over the phone, where she asked general questions like: "What office do you prefer? Would you consider a position in UK after the internship?" One week later I had the first technical interview. The interview started with 5 minutes of questions about my work, then we jumped into one coding interview question. The question was simple: Write a function which given two binary numbers as strings returns the sum of them in binary. 5 minutes for my questions at the end. Few hours after the interview, I got an email from the recruiter saying that the feedback is very good and they would like to schedule the final interview. The last interview was easier than the first one: "Given a list of strings, return a list of lists, where each list consists of words that are anagrams." Example: Given ["cab", "cz", "abc", "bca", "zc"] the output should be: [ [ "abc", "bca", "cab"] , [ "zc", cz"]]. I managed to finish this question quite fast (after only 15 min). The interviewer wanted to finish the interview after 15 minutes, but I insisted to get another question. The next question I've got was even easier: "Write a function which returns the nth number of Fibonacci". When I've seen the question I jumped straight away implementing it (took me like 2 minutes), then we compared the iterative method with the recursive one. After the interview, I got an email from the recruiter saying that my coding skills are very good, but the interviewer complained about the fact that I was a bit careless when answering the questions, and that I didn't explained him the Fibo solution before writing code. They wanted to schedule another interview. One week later I had the last interview, which was some kind of giving me another chance, because they usually have only 2 interviews. The last interview was much more difficult than the other two. The first question was: "Write a recursive function which given a string, prints all the subsets of it." After solving this question, he added one constraint. Now what if you want only unique solutions? This was quite hard, and I only managed to solve it after he gave me one important hint. The second day I received a standard rejection email.

Given a string write a function which prints all the subsets of the string. Now make the function to return only unique solutions. For example if they give you "abc" you print out a ab abc ac b bc c Now for the unique solution constraint, if they give you "aba" the output should be: a ab aba b   7 Answers

I was referred by an employee and received an email reply within 48 hours (Oct 28). My recruiter set up a phone screen within the week. It was a 45 minute technical interview that I found a solution for. Again, within 48 hours I received an email saying that I passed. Facebook gave me an option of three "University day" on-site interview dates, each about a week apart from each other. I chose the last date, Dec 3rd, almost a month later. Facebook will cover all of your traveling fees, so no worries about the cost of flying across the country. The internship on-sites start with one 45-minute interview, then lunch (good food!), then a tour, then a quick presentation about why Facebook employees love working at FB, then an open Q&A with new FB employees. By chance, my recruiter was hosting the interview group, so I got a super early-bird heads up that I received an offer before I even left FB headquarters! From what I gather by talking to other interviewees, you might have to wait 3 or 4 days to hear back from your recruiter. Good luck, everyone!

Facebook loves graph theory and tree questions. Study up on these for sure. I feel like my questions were of average difficulty, not hard by any means. Some of the other interviewees I talked to received recycled questions that I've seen on this site and on careercup.   1 Answer

The first one was an on-campus interview. It was 45 minutes long and consisted of 2 coding questions. The first one was checking if a string is palindrome the second one is to print out all the subsets. The second round was two weeks later. It was a 45 minute phone interview. The question was to multiply two numbers that are represented in string. My advice is that don't panic when you are given a hard question. I did not finish my last question and luckily still got the offer. Just try your best to show them how you approach the problem and be passionate and confidant!

The process started out with a pre-screening test which was coding based. There was one question to be done in 60 minutes. The question was fairly simple for me and I completed it quickly. Then, I was called for the onsite interviews a week later. The interview was supposed to last for 45 minutes. Now, in my interview, I was first asked about the best experience I have had in my last two years. Then, the interviewer quickly moved on to the coding questions. There were two questions for which I had to explain my solution and then code it on the whit board. I was able to both the questions, but I guess the interviewer might not have liked the way I had explained my approach as I was not called for the next interview. The interviewer was not very vocal and did not really participate in the discussion where you explain the approach. That is why it becomes difficult to detect if the interviewer is understanding your words or not. Anyways, it was a some experience.

Facebook recruiters come to my university each year to recruit talent. In November, a recruiter reached out to me to see if I would be interested in an opportunity at Facebook during the summer. I hadn't been looking for internships at the time, nor did I apply to Facebook, so I was pretty surprised by the message. After I told them I would be interested, I had a phone screening with a recruiter, during which they asked me pretty basic technical questions (a question about Java key words, can't remember the rest). I did well enough to pass this stage and then I was given the option to go for a phone interview, or an on campus interview. My recruiter told me that candidates usually do better during on campus interviews, so I was scheduled for one a month later. My on campus interview went really well, and the interviewer was really nice and easy to talk to. I got a message from my recruiter that night that I would have the opportunity to fly out to their main office for a final round interview. I attended their "Intern Day", which was a day filled with one 45-minute interview, an informational session about the internship program, a tour of the office, talks given by current Facebook engineers, and also lunch in their cafeteria. My interview could have been better- I got the answer, but I stumbled a bit along the way. I recognized my errors pretty quickly and was able to correct myself throughout the process, so I think this was a plus. I was contacted the week after my interview about different internship positions available at Facebook. After considering the options, I was given an offer for the SDE intern position about a week after that. The entire process spanned 5 months, but it was totally worth it!

Nice weather. Nice people (candidates and campus tour guide). Nice food! There was only 1 interview in the morning (I heard there were 3 rounds for full-time). It was 45 minutes, consists of general questions and 1 coding question. I didn't do well for the coding one. I couldn't solve the problem and tried so many ways to solve it. Finally, the interviewer gave me the approach to solve it, and let me code. I didn't code well though, so many mistakes. After the interview, I had a tour around the campus. I still shocked from the interview and thought I wouldn't pass.. and I didn't :) However, I really had a great time at Facebook HQ. I thought about the question again and it wasn't hard..

The interview process comprised of a technical round held at my university. My interviewer was very polite, and patiently explained the problem statement to me.

The problem was to convert roman literals into its equivalent numeric value. I used the whiteboard to solve the problem. I walked the interviewer through the solution and he asked questions on edge case scenarios. Overall, the interview went ok, but I did not receive a next round call. This was probably because my solution was not optimal and upto their expectations. It was a good experience and I learnt a lot from it

And as I was coding, he was asking me why I was doing them and suggested me to improve the algorithm.

I had two technical interviews, both on the phone since I live in Europe and all of Facebook's development is done in the U.S. They talk to you on the phone while asking questions, then you code in an online text editor of which they can see the results live as well. They're very reasonable during these interviews: when you didn't quite get a question, they'll happily explain it better, if your answer is good but not quite there, they'll point you in the direction they want to hear more details about, and so on.

I had an initial informal interview with the campus recruiter who got me a technical phone interview. The technical interview was on the phone, was 45 minutes long, and consisted of two programming questions that were relatively easy. The recruiter was pretty friendly, and the interviewer was pretty cordial. I felt confident about the interview, but I was told I wasn't a good fit.

I applied for the position when Facebook was interviewing on campus. Emailed my resume on the deadline, called up for interview within 5 days. After passing the first interview, I was informed that evening that I had a second interview the next day. After that, it was about a week or so before I heard back, and since I was a graduate student the third and last stage was to match me with a particular group. Within a few days of the matching process (done via phone) I received my offer letter. The two on-campus interviews consisted of writing down actual code (in my case, I used Java) and they were fairly basic and specific data structures related questions.

Stopped by Facebook's table at my university's career fair to drop off my resume. Got an email in about a week saying they wanted to interview me at my university's career center. If I did well on my interview, they would schedule another one for me the next day. First interview was 30-min, one technical coding question and "Why Facebook?" Found out that evening that I was invited for another interview the next day. Second interview was 45-min, 3 technical coding questions and "Why Facebook?" (again) Recruiter emailed all my university recruits saying they would collect results and let us know within a week. Tuesday, got an email from my recruiter saying I did well on my interviews. She introduced me to a different recruiter, to whom I had to send my availability for a phone call to discuss next steps. I thought I needed to schedule another interview; however it turns out my recruiter was calling me to extend me an offer.

Facebook visited my university. We had a 45 min test and some of us were invited for 1:1 interview next day. After that interview, recruiter contacted me like 2-3 weeks later and arranged phone interview. Interviewers were very friendly. At the start they told me something about what they are working on, they gave me a small programming challenge. Interviewer wanted to know about my ideas for solving the problem and gave small hints if I got stuck.

The interviewers were very nice - couldn't understand what one interviewer was saying, but he wrote the tasks and it was ok in the end. Had planned 3 technical interviews in total, failed the last one. The recruiters were extremely nice and prompt. Will definitely apply next year, all the interviewers seemed to be energetic and enthusiastic about their work - sound like the team I want to be part of and definitely worth the struggle.

Contacted by recruiter who found my profile online. Had a chat with their university recruiter, then two 45-minute on-campus interviews. First one consisted of two relatively straightforward coding questions (but had some bugs in solution to second question, which were spotted and corrected). Second interview consisted of talking about prior projects for first ~20 minutes, then two algorithm questions (asked for hints on the first one), then I got to ask questions.

I submitted my resume on my college's career development website in January. I got an email from Facebook saying that they wanted to interview me about a month after I sent them my resume. They scheduled one 45-minute interview for me, during which I had to solve 2 different programming problems. When I passed the first interview round, they scheduled a very similar 45-minute interview within the same week. The whole interview process took only 2 weeks, and they called me about the offer in 2 business days. This was definitely the most efficient hiring process I've ever been a part of.
